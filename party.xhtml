<h1>Monthly Dances</h1>

<p>On the second Saturday of most months, the Portland branch has a dance party
at Waluga Lodge.  Though some months have prizes, some have giveaways, and
others have live music, every month has dancing!  For 2012, the parties
are (tentatively) scheduled for 10/13, 11/10, and 12/8; for 2013, the parties are scheduled for 1/12, 2/9, 4/13, 5/11, 10/12, 11/9, and 12/14.</p>

<p>All of the Portland parties are at the Waluga Hall at 7:30pm.</p>

<p>The <a href="workshop.html">Ball</a> is held in March.</p>
