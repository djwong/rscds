<h1>Monthly Dances</h1>

<p>On the second Saturday of every month (except March and August), the Portland
branch has a dance party at Tigard Grange.  Though some months have prizes, some have
giveaways, and others have live music, every month has dancing!  For 2008, the parties
are (tentatively) scheduled for 1/12, 2/9, 4/12, 5/10, 6/14(?), 10/11, 11/8 and 12/13.</p>
