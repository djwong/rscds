<h1>Monthly Dances</h1>

<p>On the second Saturday of every month (except March and August), the
Portland branch has a dance party at Tigard Grange.  Though some months have
prizes, some have giveaways, and others have live music, every month has
dancing!  For 2010-2011, the parties are (tentatively) scheduled for 10/9,
11/13, 12/11, 2/12, 4/9, and 5/14.  Parties are not held in January, and the <a
