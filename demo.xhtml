<h1>Demonstrations</h1>

<p>The Portland Branch has a demonstration team that performs
at various Scottish events and also at area retirement homes
on request.</p>

<p>Our Demonstration Team is available to dance at your
function. We can perform dances and, if you would like,
teach a few dances to those in attendance. Prices depend on
location, performance length, and number of dancers
involved. Ask for details.</p>
