<h2>What is Scottish Country Dancing?</h2>

<p>Scottish Country Dancing (SCD) is the social dance form of Scotland.  Dances
are typically performed with 3-5 couples, and generally in two lines or in a
square.  The dancers work together to perform a sequence of formations which
eventually bring them back to their starting positions, each couple having
danced as the head couple at least once.  Musicians play lively music in quick
time and dramatic music for passionate dances at events small and large.  The
Royal Scottish Dance Society (<a href="http://www.rscds.org/">RSCDS</a>) has
standardized, reconstructed, and collects new dances for everyone to enjoy.</p>

<p>Scottish Country Dance is very sociable â€“ it is common to dance with many
different partners during a night of dancing, and many dancers in the Pacific
Northwest circulate around the area to the larger functions of the nearby
branches.  Thanks to the standardization efforts of the RSCDS, it is very easy
to dance with other RSCDS groups all over the world, even in the absence of a
common spoken language.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>The history of the Portland Oregon Branch started in the late 1970's when Don
Gertz first encountered Scottish Country Dancing  as part of an International
folk dance class.  He went to Seattle, where there was a flourishing SCD
community, to learn more and there he met Noel Lillie, a veteran dancer and
teacher with the Seattle Branch, and asked for his assistance in starting
classes in Portland.  Noel graciously agreed to travel to Portland to help Don
teach <a href="classes.html">classes</a>, which began in 1979 with six dancers.
In 1980 Don traveled to St. Andrews to study for, and take, his Preliminary
Certificate examination, which he passed.  By 1981 there were enough dancers to
form two sets, and the Portland Scottish Country Dance Club was formed as an
affiliate group of RSCDS.</p>

<p>The Club held its first Annual <a href="workshop.html">Workshop and Ball</a>
in 1979 and formed a <a href="demo.html">demonstration team</a> in 1981; these
activities continue to this day. In 1987 the Club had 56 RSCDS members and 3
fully certificated teachers, and applied to become a Branch.  Branch status was
granted in April 1988.  We also maintain close contact with the Southwest
Washington State <a href="http://www.vancouverusa-scd.org/">branch</a>.</p>
