<p>Ruth Jappy, Delta, BC -- Ruth Jappy grew up with Irish music & dance - especially accordions, having a father & brother who both played.  So it is no wonder she married Alex Jappy, a well-known Scottish accordionist.   She started Scottish Country Dancing in Scarborough,  Ontario in 1961, and danced with that club until 1978.   She also danced in the Toronto Branch classes and served on the various Committees for several years.  Ruth has taught workshops in Canada, the U.S., Australia & Japan also T.A.C. Summer School.  She teaches the Delta Borderers SCD Class in Vancouver, and is also well known for teaching Old Time Dancing.</p>

<p>Bruce Herbold, San Francisco, CA -- 
Bruce began Scottish Country Dancing in 1976 in Berkeley and has      
vigorously pursued it ever since.  Currently he teaches the San       
Francisco and Berkeley classes and has taught at workshops in Calgary,
Victoria Fort Worden, and Vancouver.  Over the last few years he      
co-taught the teacher training class for San Francisco.</p>
                                                                      
<p>Bruce's emphasis is on the social nature of SCD.  Sociability comes  
through most in dances that require dancers to work together, rather  
than dances which flow too smoothly.  Bruce aims to teach how to dance
as part of a team without trying to lead the team or short-change     
other team members' enjoyment.   Bruce believes that individual dance 
technique exists to make you more comfortable on your feet and better 
able to dance with the other people in your set.
