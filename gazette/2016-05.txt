== Teacher’s Corner ==
by Debbie Mc​Robert

OK, time got away from me. Here it is, April 27th, and I see in my notes that
my article for the Ghillie Gazette was due April 25th. I don’t have a subject
in mind for my article so I thought I would look through some notes I’ve taken
over the years. Here are some quotes or points that seemed to speak to me. I
have noted names if I noted them in my notebook.

If leading warm ups, practice in front of a mirror to make sure nothing
“shows”. (Me, after seeing a teacher leading some stretching exercises in a
dress she should not have been wearing for those stretches.)

The closing of a strathspey step should be a “kiss”, the feet touch (it’s not
exciting without touching), but don’t touch too hard. You could knock out some
teeth. – Ron Wallace

Let go of hands before eyes.

Work on judging distances. Don’t misjudge the last step and end up discarding
it because you have no place to go.

When dancing hands round/circles, the “lead” hand is easier to keep up at
appropriate height. It’s the trailing hand that droops.

You should always strive to improve your steps. Even just a little. Without the
effort to improve, your footwork will decline. – Ron Wallace

There’s no such thing as advanced dancing. It’s basic dancing done well. – Ruth
Jappy

Find your passion and do it not for fame, not for fortune, but because you
can’t not do it. – Jessica Fletcher, Murder She Wrote.

== Membership Dues Reminder ==
by Maureen Sloan, Membership

The Board has decided that dues will remain the same for the upcoming 2016-2017
RSCDS membership year.  This means $32 for singles; $47 for family (2 adults at
same address); $5 for a local or secondary membership.

There will be a 2016-2017 renewal form on our webpage and I will also bring
forms to dance class on Mondays. 

For those of you attending the Branch AGM on May 16th, you will need to have
renewed for the coming year in order to vote on any issues that may come up.

Come join the fun for a low key 90 minutes of SCD. Tempos are a bit calmer,
some formations are modified, and dancers are encouraged to make the dancing
work for their physical ability. We have done dances from the RSCDS books 1 and
2 and will be heading on to dances in books 3 and 4 through March. The class
starts at 7:30 on the 2nd and 4th Tuesdays each month and is held at Columbia
Dance Studio in Vancouver, WA. For more info, please call Lisa Scott at
971-227-8902.

== Texas Road Trip ==
by Holly Gibson

For the last three years, my dad, Barclay Gibson, and I have taken a three to
four-day road trip through central and eastern Texas. It started as a
wildflower tour and a chance for us to do something together, but this year the
trip had a more historical/documentary bent. Dad has a vast knowledge of the
state (evidenced whenever some hapless resident asks him where a certain town
is; the answer is usually followed by the name of the county, county seat, and
cemetery location), and for the past few years he has spent many hours on the
road documenting the centennial granite markers that dot the state (erected in
1936 to celebrate the state's centennial), courthouses, churches, jails,
depots, and cemeteries. He's met a lot of people along the way and even led a
few groups to various sites they didn't know existed even though they lived
nearby.

This year he had numerous abandoned churches and schools he wanted to find and
photograph in a number of small, isolated towns. Now, that sounds relatively
easy, but let me add that many of these old churches and schools are located on
county roads, dirt roads, and overgrown roads, not to mention bumpy roads.
There was also no one route to take that would include all of them. As we
criss-crossed through counties and around towns (I saw the sign for Crockett,
Texas at least five times but never did see the town), I realized this was very
much like the old Westerns where the hero keeps riding past the same rock. As
we went by a barn I had photographed two days before, I knew exactly how that
old cowboy felt. To be fair, every so often I'd yell for dad to stop the car
because I'd seen something I had to get a picture of. He'd slam on the brakes,
pull over, and I would run down the road and over to whatever scene had caught
my eye. We had beautiful weather each day, with dramatic spring skies of dark
clouds illuminated by the sun and set off by the bright green below.

Anyone who has not visited Texas probably envisions a mix of images from
Western movies, Pace picante sauce commercials, and anything else stark and
dusty in nature. In fact, a wide expanse of dirt, scrub, and tumble weeds
likely comes to mind. True, that landscape does exist, but so does one of
winding roads over grass-covered hills disappearing into thick forests, of
bluebonnets and Indian paintbrush dotting the roadsides and nearby fields and
huge wisteria draped over wooden fencing. In fact, while driving through north
central Texas, I had to keep reminding myself I wasn't in Oregon anymore.

After three days of old buildings and back roads, we headed for Dallas,
stopping every now and then for the bluebonnets. After getting oriented to
Dallas and its traffic (which is not nearly as bad as Portland’s), we went to
the Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Garden. This wasn’t quite Dad’s thing so he
good naturedly read for about three hours while I swarmed around the gardens.
The azaleas, rhododendrons, delphiniums, impatiens, and about every other
spring flower you can think of were on full display. Just combine the Portland
Japanese Garden, Lan Su Chinese Garden, and the Crystal Springs Rhododendron
Garden, and you'll have a good idea of what it was like. There were also
numerous water features, which meant using a nearby sign and my handy rice
“beanbag” as a makeshift tripod in order to slow the exposure time down to give
the water a smooth texture. I had my excuse all ready in case an employee asked
what I was doing with their sign.

Then we met my aunt and cousin for dinner (and our third night of Mexican food)
and enjoyed catching up with them. The next day I spent some time in a nearby
park enjoying the sunshine and heavy smell of honeysuckle before heading to the
airport and back to real life. Of course, all us Scottish Country Dancers know
that reel life is really pretty good.

Note from the author: Lest anyone who happens to read this thinks I have a very
strange idea of what is Celtic in nature (although there are cities named
Edinburg and Dublin in Texas) submitting an article to the newsletter on a
Texas road trip was not my idea.
