== From The President ==

by

'''Holly Gibson'''

'''O'''nce again the annual workshop and ball is upon us and, once again, everyone has been ready and willing to help out. From decorations to the raffle, registration packets and parking detail, it’s great to see everyone work together and come up with ways to make this “the best workshop and ball ever!” (until next year’s best ever workshop and ball, of course). Once the workshop and ball are over, summer is just around the corner and after that, a new dance season. A majority of the board has served the maximum number of terms and we are asking folks to consider the positions of president, vice-president, member at large, and secretary. If you’ve ever had an inkling (or even half an inkling) of serving on a board or being part of the inner workings of a group, this is a great opportunity to learn more about the branch, your fellow dancers, and even what hidden talents you possess, by venturing out and seeking a position. No former expertise is required because everyone is in this together and willing to help when necessary, and I can personally attest to that. See you all on the dance floor.

== SCD Ties ==

by

'''Martin MacKenzie'''

'''I'''n my years in SCD, one of the interesting and enjoyable elements of this activity is the contacts made and ties made across the years and across the miles. A number of years ago now, Chandi McCracken was attending college out here at Portland State University and she became part of the dance community when the Portland Branch was using the Tigard Grange for their dance venue. She has since moved back to Minnesota where she's from and has established a career and is married now. We've kept in contact through the years she remembers her friends she made out here.

About a week or two ago, both she and her father Andrew remembered that I was a Gàidhlig learner and speaker and knew that I continued to have an interest in Gàidhlig music. Recently, the Gàidlig Supergroup Dàimh had played out in the Minneapolis area and they so enjoyed it that they looked up the band's itinerary and noticed that they would be coming to the Portland area and would be playing at the Alladin Theater.

Though I knew of Dàimh, I'd not really listened to them or had any recorded music from them. However, I picked up tickets, and as I do when I can, I threw out invitations to come to other dancers in the area to come and enjoy this with us. Most of them were busy this time around, however, we were surprised to see Louise, one of the new Vancouver area dancers and she decided to hand out with us even though she had spent money for the more pricey "gold circle" seats closer to the stage.

We each enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and I had to opportunity to twice go to the "merch table" and using my schoolhouse Gàidhlig, purchase a CD and then what they group jokingly called a dishtowel but was really a flag with the band logo on it but which came along with a download of another album from the Bandcamp service. That along with dinner at Thai Touch, a restaurant recommended by another SCD friend we all know, Cynthia Soohoo completed the evening.

'''Choosing partners:'''

 * Dance with as many different partners as possible.
 * Ask a partner to dance after the dance is announced, not before.
 * It is acceptable for less experienced dancers to ask an “expert” to dance and for a lady to ask a man.
 * At social dances and balls, don’t book dances ahead, with occasional exceptions for a very favorite dance or a very favorite partner.  Booking ahead makes it difficult for everyone to find partners and enjoy the dance.
 * At local social dances and balls, be a good host - dance with out-of-town guests, strangers and newcomers and help them feel welcome.

'''Forming sets:'''

 * Form sets after the dance is announced, not before.
 * Long-wise sets are formed from the top (nearest the music).  Each couple joins at the bottom of the set.
 * The top couple of the line counts the sets.  When reaching the bottom, they indicate to the person directing the dance how many couples are needed as well as signaling when the sets are complete.
 * If one person of a couple is temporarily alone in a long-wise set (partner fixing a shoe, getting a drink, briefing the dance, etc.), the person waiting in the set stands on the men’s side of the dance until the sets are counted.
 * Join a square, round-the-room, or triangular set in any position.
 * If you are not comfortable with your place in the set, ask another couple in the same set if they are willing to exchange places.
 * Try not to leave a set after the lines are counted or during a dance.

'''Dance Reminders:'''

 * “Cheat sheets” are brief notes of the essentials of how to do a dance. Refer to these notes before the talk-through and not on the dance floor or during the dance.
 * A talk-through is a brief, spoken instruction before the dance begins. Instructions are usually given in eight-bar phrases.  Listen and try to imagine the pattern of each phrase. Do not talk. Clarifying questions 
 . should be directed to the person briefing the dance, not to your fellow dancers. That allows others to benefit from the question.

'''During the Dance:'''

 * Begin with a smile to your partner during the bow and curtsy.
 * Keep lines of the sets straight to help “anchor” the set.
 * Be alert and anticipate what comes next.
 * Be sociable - give eye contact to other dancers.
 * Help others with gestures and quiet instructions.  Try not to shout to others in the set.
 * Mistakes are okay, everyone makes them.  Just try to keep dancing and sort yourselves out to be ready for the next phrase or repeat of the dance.
 * At the end of the dance, thank your partner and others in the set.  Escort your partner off the dance floor.

== Will Travel, Must Have Ghillies ==

This last February, a journey to King of Prussia, PA was mandated by my company and as I'm wont to do, I scoped out my destination and looked for dancing opportunities at or near the destination.

I discovered that there was a class to the east of King of Prussia in Chestnut Hills run by Geoffrey Selling who some of you may know is an adjudicator for folks who are aspiring to become Scottish Country Dance Teachers.

I also learned that transportation wasn't going to be easy as the class location was about a half hour away. However, Scottish inginuity and thriftiness being what it is, research was begun into other means of transport and were looked into and it was decided to use Über instead of a local taxi service as the rates were cheaper and I was able to use this to argue for compensation from the company because I spent very little of their money for meals, etc.

When I travel, especially when I'm spending time with folks who serve me either by transportation or some other means, I like to have a conversation and learn something. This I did with the two Über drivers.

Kenneth, the first Über driver took me out to Chestnut Hill. He drives full time and is going back to college to obtain a degree in home care administration because his Mom will give him two home care businesses she now runs. He's married and his wife has worked for QBC for thirty years but is looking for another job as she smells trouble coming. A real hustler.

Khalid was the second Über driver who drove me back to the hotel in King of Prussia from Chestnut Hill. He's originally from Morocco. He's married with three children, two daughters and a son. His Mom is still alive but Dad has passed away recently, I think. He's 51 years old but his children are young. He knows the story of the movie Casablanca and of the woman who opened a restaurant with the same name as the famous one in the movie, Rick's Café in Morocco. Khalid knows the phrase, "Easy peezy lemon squeezy" having learned that from one of his daughters. Khalid is very much a man devoted to his family.

As to the class, it is more devoted to beginners but I was pleased to participate and be one of the experienced helper dancers. Everyone was very kind and it was interesting to learn that this class had an unusually high number of folks who hadn't danced but less than a year. As a nod to more advanced beginners or advanced dancers, The Bees of Maggieknockater was the last dance of the evening.

Thanks to Geoffrey Selling for linking me up with yet another SCD class in yet another part of the USA that I'd not visited until this trip!

== Scottish Fisherman Superstitions ==

(Compiled by Melissa Whitson from information collected by Martin Evans and by Margaret Umphrey)

Every country has its share of superstitions.  In the 19th and early 20th century in Scotland, there were many superstitions associated with sea fishing (as opposed to river fishing).  In those times, the fisherman typically spent weeks out 
at sea so a safe return was not at all assured.  Superstitions naturally developed over time and varied by locality.  Here are some interesting examples.

 * Some fishermen would not sail if they passed a nun, crow, cat, dog, rabbit, or a redheaded person on the way to their vessel.
 * Some fishermen would not sail if they saw a rat some ashore off their vessel (perhaps the rat knew something they didn’t?) or if pigeons or doves were found on board.
 * When leaving the harbor, always turn the boat clockwise.
 * Never stir tea with a knife or fork.
 * The teapot must not be emptied after the fishing had started. To empty it might make the ship turn over and sink, or result in a poor trip.
 * Never lay a broom on top of the nets.
 * Egg shells should be broken into tiny pieces (to stop witches sailing in them).
 * The salt-pot must not be handed from one crewman to another – “pass salt, pass sorrow”.
 * Upturning a hatch cover or sleeping on the stomach were actions said to anticipate the boat turning over and sinking.
 * Losing a hat overboard signified a long trip.
 * For good luck, eat fish from the head to the tail. Starting at the tail will warn the shoals away from the shore and back into deep water.
 * Set an odd number of nets, such as 101; the extra one is “for luck.”
 * Don’t count the number of fish caught as it will result in no more fish being caught that day. Count the fish when safely back in port.
 * Don’t use certain words at sea. Don’t mention pigs, fox, cat, rabbit, salmon, rat, or the church or churchmen. Substitute words such as curly tail for pig, long tail for rat, <<BR>> 
 . and black coat for minister. If the bad word is accidentally spoken, the antidote is to quickly touch cauld iron.
 * Don’t wash the herring scales from boots or deck. It will wash away good luck.
 * Don’t go to sea at the start of the fishing season until a few drops of blood have been shed by a crew member in a fight or accident.
 * Throw one of the crew members overboard and then haul him back in.  The fish will follow suit.

The wives of the fishermen also had superstitions.  These were important to observe in order to make sure the men returned safely.

 * A woman must not say that she was going to “wash” clothes; otherwise her husband would be “washed” overboard.
 * Don’t “wave” good-bye or else a “wave” would sweep him away.
 * Don’t call out after him once he sets foot outside the front door.
 * Don’t go down on the fish dock to see him off.
 * Don’t whistle, as this would cause a storm at sea as “A whistling woman and a crowing hen, Bring the Devil out of his den.”
