== Volcanic Disasters ==

by

'''Kevin Scott'''

'''D'''ear Fellow Dancers, I have not been doing much dancing, in part because of Parkinson’s but mainly because of the final details of publishing a book, “The Voice of This Stone—Learning from Volcanic Disasters Around the World”. Each chapter is my experiences and scientific conclusions at each of many volcanoes around the Pacific Rim of Fire, plus Vesuvius and Campi Flegrei. The book has received great reviews and has a wonderful website, http://www.volcanicdisasters.com 

I think, if you like volcanoes, you will like the book.

== Teacher’s Corner: The Role of Dance Role Models ==

by

'''Melissa Whitson'''

'''A'''ll of us are role models for newer dancers – either inadvertently or purposefully. Through observation, inexperienced dancers absorb our good and our not so good behaviors – including our dancing technique, styling and our social conduct. I know this first hand! When I was first learning to dance, I was bending my big toe under and dragging it behind me while I was bringing my trailing foot through as part of the strathspey travelling step. I did this because that is how I observed the teacher dancing the step. I did what she (inadvertently) demonstrated, not what she said when she made her teaching points.

The experienced dancers in the Portland and Vancouver area dance communities provide excellent role models overall. However, there are instances where we should ask ourselves if we are (inadvertently) presenting less desirable role models.
    
First, the good!  In the below situations I think our experienced dancers set splendid examples:
 *Newer dancers attending classes are actively welcomed.
 *Their dancing efforts are encouraged.
 *Information is shared, questions answered, and efforts are made to try to ease their entry into our dance 
 community.
 *Newer dancers are quickly asked to be dance partners.
 *Experienced dancers patiently attend beginner level classes to lend support in numbers and spirit.
 *Newer dancers receive invitations to non-dancing social events.

Second, here are examples of when we generally model beneficial behaviors but perhaps we could do so more 
consistently:
 *Partnering with a variety of dancers.  Why not make a point of asking someone to dance who, despite 
 your good intentions, somehow rarely is your partner?	
 *Good-hearted and light-hearted acceptance of mistakes made by other dancers and by ourselves.  
 Newer dancers need assurance that mistakes (by everyone!) are normal, common, and expected.
 *Not over helping a newer dancer during a dance.  It is confusing if multiple dancers in a set provide 
 guidance to a newer dancer simultaneously; also, letting them learn from their own mistakes is sometime 
 the most helpful.
 *Proactive sharing of information about shoes, dress norms, and online resources.

Lastly, we should consider if we are being good role models in the following situations:
 *Do we talk in class such that others may not be able to hear the instruction?  Echoing halls and hearing 
 loss can make even quiet talking problematic.
 *Do we make unkind remarks about other dancers or teachers?  These are our friends!
 *Do we look at the floor when we could be giving a friendly face to another dancers, for example, when 
 *we cross or turn or reel or step up?
 *Do we stomp our feet or click our heels during the change in direction in quick time circles?  Yes, this can 
 be fun but it’s not the SCD norm so perhaps it is not the best dancing style to be modelling for beginners.
 *Do we dance with one (uninjured) arm behind our back?  This is not SCD style and it might seem a bit unsocial 
 to other dancers.
 *Do we sometimes focus on our own fun, inadvertently to the detriment of others in the set?  

For example:
 *Do we lead down the middle so far that it is impossible to return on time for the next figure, thereby impeding 
 other dancers from starting the next phrase on time?
 *Do we dance quick time circles too fast so the change in direction is uncontrolled, not on the musical phrase, 
 and other dancers may be pulled off their feet?
 *Do we add extra twiddles and pivots that may confuse a newer dancer or impede another dancer from being where 
 they need to be? Taking a few liberties with a dance can be good fun, but we should consider who is in the set and 
 ask ourselves if it a considerate thing to do during the active teaching of a figure or portion of a dance.
 *Do we have our shoes on and are ready by the start time of class (traffic and personal woes being worthy 
 exceptions, of course)?
    
As we know, Scottish Country dancing is tremendous fun, and we don’t want to get overly fussy about styling and technique. That said, providing strong role models helps to develop our newer dancers and supports the continuing uniqueness of the Scottish Country dance style. Personally, I extend a big thanks to the experienced dancers in our community for their continuing efforts to grow our newer dancers; well integrated newer dancers will position our groups to be dancing strong in the years ahead.

'''I'''f someone had told me a little over a year ago I would be involved in Scottish Country dancing my response would have been incredulous laughter. My dancing experiences consisted of a best forgotten year-long stint as a seven-year old ballerina and an occasional swing dance routine with college friends. So when my Mom, who lives 1,700 miles away but gets the local Lake Oswego paper, told me about an ad she had seen for a Scottish Country dance class practically in my backyard. My response was the typical “whatever” eye roll. I made a concerted effort to “forget” about the class. But as summer drew to a close and some of my other outdoor activities were winding up, I decided to give it a try. After all, it was free the first time and if, and I was sure when, I found Scottish dancing wasn’t my thing I wasn’t out any money and I could say I had tried it.

Except it didn’t quite work out that way. I don’t remember a lot about that first class, except no one else was in running shoes. But that didn’t seem to matter. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming and eager to help those of us who were new. We did a few simple dances, and it dawned on me that this was a lot of fun, not to mention great exercise that didn’t involve being out in the rain. Plus, there was this terrific music to listen to and almost be part of. The only downside to all this fun was having to admit to my Mom that she was right, something she won’t let me forget. But now the ghillie is on the other foot and she is the one rolling her eyes when I go dancing multiple times a week, plan my vacation return flight around the monthly dance in Lake Oswego, and walk to workshops wearing running shoes and a skirt.

'''I''''ll exercise a little prerogative which I hope you'll all find in your hearts to forgive. For those who know, my mother Mary MacKenzie passed away in her home May 30th of this year, as far as those of us who remain can tell, exactly as she wanted it. However, this is not what I want all y'all to think of. She also came with us from time to time and observed our dancing.

This photo was taken at the "222" themed Vancouver spring dance in 2008. One of the things that Mom observed was, "The dancing looks complicated."

In her younger years, she had tried square dancing and, even later in life before her legs wouldn't support such endeavors, her neighbor across the street, Agnes, persuaded her to go to a beginning square dance class at her own square dance club. She found it a little too intense so soon after Dad's passing but it was interesting to me that she tried.

The moral of this story, at least as I declare it, is that we should make contact with observers and, if possible, encourage them to participate with us in the future. Show them your enjoyment of the dance and infect them with the disease!

== Dancing in Scottish Castles Tour ==

by

'''Susan Shaw'''

''From the September/October 2005 edition of The Scottish Country Dancer. ~ The Editor''

What would it be like to dance a Scottish dance in a Scottish castle? Imagine dancing "Ye'll Aye be Welcome Back Again", or any of the other dances from the Menzies manuscript (dated 1749), in Castle Menzies, where the manuscript was discovered!

Prompted partly by such romantic curiosity, John and I joined Ken McFarland's Dancing in Scottish Castles tour; and, in the company of about 30 other dancers and two musicians, we danced, walked, and toured our way across the width of Scotland, as well as a good bit of its height.

We were unprepared for the sights of original Edinburgh surrounding the castle. The sooty black gothic tower built in Sir Walter Scott's memory was hard on our eyes, but "new town" built at the end of the 18th century was charming. Modern shops crowd next to woolen mill outlets and Scottish items galore, including a full range of kilt attire. In August, cashmere scarves are on "SALE" throughout Scotland. Within walking distance of our hotel were several curved streets (called a "crescent") flanked by a row of tall townhouses. It turns out that the headquarters of RSCDS is in one of these crescents and a fun thing to do is to have your picture taken next to the large portrait of Miss Milligan.

Our tour took us south of Edinburgh across the Borders to Holy Isle on the east coast, then up through the Highlands and over to the Isle of Skye, which is part of the Inner Hebrides, and down to Ayrshire, the land of Robert Burns - all on the west coast. We were blessed with good weather and clear views the entire trip.

We learned that the first castles were built in the 12th century to protect against Viking invaders. In the 16th century, better and bigger castles were built on their ruins. Then, many castle-like mansions and large estates were built in the Victorian Medieval style in the early 1800s. We saw and/or danced in all three kinds of castles, as well as hotel ballrooms, to the music of Duncan Smith (piano) and Catherine Fraser (fiddle), the two fine Australian musicians who traveled with us.

One special memory was standing on the Brigadoon (bridge over the River Doon, in Ayr) and listening to fellow traveler Norm McCallum and John Shaw take turns reciting the Robert Burns' poem, Tam O'Shanter. It was on this bridge that the beautiful witch, Nanny (nicknamed Cutty Sark), was left holding the tail of Tam's horse as he sped across the bridge to escape her. (As we all know, a witch cannot cross a running stream.)

The ruins of the abbey, where Tam first spied the witches dancing "hornpipes, jigs, strathspeys, and reels," are just a short walk from the bridge, and in the graveyard there we saw the graves of Robert Burns' mother and father, who both outlived Robert by many years. It seems that all of Scotland loves Burns, and in Ayrshire he is everywhere. I loved the museum next to his birthplace cottage, which has an extensive collection of his original writings, including handwritten letters and tributes to friends written in perfect English as well as works in his native Scots tongue.

In the lowlands we visited the home built by Sir Walter Scott, the great historic fiction novelist, who loved to collect books as well as memorabilia from famous warriors and anything Scottish, including Rob Roy's sword and gun, Napoleon's journal and pen set, and full suits of armor from the 16th century. We all loved his walled flower garden, which was my favorite of all the gardens on the tour.

So, you get the idea that Scotland is a great place to visit, especially in August when the weather is the best, though the prices are the highest then - except for cashmere, of course.

When all the pictures are developed and sorted, we'd love to share.
