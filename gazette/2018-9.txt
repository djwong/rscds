== New Dance Year, PDX ==

by

'''Holly Gibson'''

'''E'''very year about this time we marvel that summer is almost over and dancing season is drawing close. It can’t be that time already, we collectively gasp. The good news is, yes it really is time to start dancing again.

One of the best things about being a dancer is not only the dancing but the numerous fringe benefits. There are places I’ve been and people I’ve met all because of our dancing community, and I bet most of you could say the same thing. Each of you is a part of that community and so here’s a reminder that as the season changes and it’s cold and wet outside and you’re tempted to stay in with a good book or watch your favorite TV show, or avoid the traffic on I-5, just remember there’s a roomful of people hoping you’ll join them in the laughter that follows a dance done well (or even, maybe especially, when not), and in the friendship that comes from doing something with a group of people sharing a similar interest. I hope to see you all in a few weeks with your ghillies on ready to dance!

== Popular Scottish Dances and Music ==

by

'''Tom Halpenny'''

'''RSCDS''' HQ requested that branches provide a list of dances which are popular amongst dancers, in order to receive input for the 2019 book of 30 popular dances. Our Branch leaders had a discussion of its popular dances. We generated a frequency-sorted list of dances in programmes (April 2010 - June 2018) which can be viewed here.
http://www.rscds-swws.org/meetings/2018-09-15/c-08-SWWS-Popular-Dances.pdf
We observed the issue that the programme devisers influence the frequency of dances but not necessarily the popularity of dances, but the list of dances was a good starting point to stimulate the discussion.

    
Our list of popular dances is:

Delvine Side
The Reel of the Royal Scots
Da Rain Dancin'
Follow Me Home
Hooper's Jig
Shiftin' Bobbins
The Cranberry Tart
The Australian Ladies (does not appear on any programme)
    

I am also interested to learn the reasons why a dance is popular, and I observed a significant reason. The dances all have interesting choreography, but a quality that really helps the popularity is excellent music that accompanies the dancing. A popular dance has great music that plays in our mind after we have danced. Therefore, we expect that an electronic music publication that accompanies the 30 popular dances book will have close to thirty inspiring music tracks.

An issue is that there exist regional preferences for music, related to two distinct cultures of preferred Scottish dance music instrumentation: accordion band and fiddle & piano. Our branch is located in an area of North America where fiddle & piano is preferred, where the typical line-up of live music is the fiddle & piano band. RSCDS will be challenged to record an electronic publication that will generate high customer satisfaction for both markets.

I researched accordion and fiddle & piano music clips for the Branch's list of popular dances. We can listen to the music clips in the following table. Which column of music do you prefer? The answer probably depends on the preferred Scottish dance music culture where you dance.

== Teachers's Corner ==

by

'''Don Gertz''''

'''H'''aving been out of town for most of May and all of June along with the summer off season, I really need my weekly dancing fix!

Welcome to a new dancing season. Our teachers are really looking forward to meeting old and new friends and helping everyone have fun. Scottish Country Dancing is a social activity and we do it because we enjoy the music, dancing and the people.

As teachers, our goal is to teach dancing rather than just dances. In order to do this, we teach the steps, floor formations (also called figures), terminology and the way they all work together with the music and other dancers to create a pleasing and fun time for everyone involved. There are many formations and variations along with the five (5) basic steps and their variations. There are also well over 10,000 Scottish Country Dances that have been devised since the mid-1700’s. Obviously no one can know them all, but there are quite a few dances that are popular world-wide and others that are local favorites.

Our classes are divided into two levels, Basic or Beginning and Intermediate. Most new dancers will find that it takes a year to learn and be comfortable with the steps and basic figures before being invited to join the Intermediate class. Square dancers have the “basic 100” figures and then more advanced ones. We don’t have that many basic figures, but there are a lot of ways that some of them can be done. Our teachers will guide you through the journey and try to make learning fun and at the same time challenge your brains.

Some basic guidelines:

 *	We’re here to have fun.
 *	The Beginners class belongs to the Beginners. Intermediate dancers are welcome and encouraged to attend and help our new dancers.
 *	If you don’t understand what the teacher is saying or demonstrating, please ask the teacher, not another dancer. There are probably other people who don’t understand either. It’s the teacher’s job to explain it clearly.
 * 	Beginners are welcome to stay and watch the Intermediate class. Intermediates should not ask new dancers to dance during the Intermediate class without checking with the teacher first. This will make everyone more comfortable.
 *	If you are not dancing, please watch what’s going on or keep your conversations quiet. We all enjoy visiting, but it can be distracting during class.
 *	The Beginners class starts at 7:30. Please be ready so that we have more time to dance.
 *	The semi-monthly dances will have dances taught in both classes and are split 50-50 beginner and intermediate dances. Most beginner dances will be walked through and intermediate        dances will be briefed with some walk-throughs. We also carry over a certain number of dances from one month to the next.
 *	We strongly encourage new dancers to start coming to the semi-monthly 2nd Saturday dances right away. The sooner you start dancing in a social atmosphere, the sooner you’ll begin to fully enjoy our pastime.
 *	Above all – Enjoy Yourselves.



== Cape Breton, Nova Scotia ==

'''Martin MacKenzie'''

'''O'''ur little journey began earlier last year when we had a discussion about the lack of traditional music to be found and experienced during our trip to Scotland the summer of 2016. One of our memories from our stay at the Salutation Hotel in downtown Perth was a wee pub we visited across the street. Though the interactions and culture were much as we expected to experience there, the kind of music that was performed was John Denver and Randy Newman! Quite disappointing to American ears wanting to at least feel like we had escaped from home for a little while.

How to make that happen? I considered and in fact reserved an apartment for two weeks in Glasgow, Scotland and a rental car just to ensure a foothold with the idea of driving out to various places using our flat as a home base. I continued to research this and was reminded that Scottish culture had suffered during the beginning of mass media during the BBC era and many musicians and tradition bearers had been lost during WWI and WWII, especially from the Highland areas. Though traditional music can be found, it is often spread out geographically into areas difficult to reach from the city during a day. Not to say that a return trip might not happen, at least this time it didn't seem to make as much sense.

I had learned about the history of Cape Breton and wondered if that would be a more efficient means of finding traditional music currently. I knew that there was a pub in the Mabou area called the Red Shoe owned by a Canadian family musical group called the Rankins that had long history on the island going back to the seventeen or eighteen hundreds from Highland Scotland. Here's an example of the sound that made them popular in Canada.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF5g6ajFGr0 After all that and watching dances and musicians local to the area on the Internet, many of them performing at the Red Shoe during their active months, I decided that we would set sail for Mabou, Cape Breton right in the heart of it all.

This was one of the best travel decisions ever made. We found Cape Breton to be more Scottish than Scotland itself in most areas of Cape Breton but for the Acadian French part from Cheticamp north along the west coast towards the Cape Breton Highlands national park. Even in Cheticamp itself, a pub called The Doryman often has Scottish music playing in the evenings. In addition to dual language Gàidhlig and English signs found everywhere, there are Scottish placenames galore such as Inverness, Dunvegan, Dingwall, Iona, etc. We by tradition will attend local services where possible, and in this case we attended services in Judique at St. Andrews Catholic Church and where there was a description of something or a name for something written in English in the sanctuary, there was a Gàidhlig name for it with the Gàidhlig taking prominance. We stumbled across a wee tongue in cheek sign on the way north to our B & B in Mabou which said, "Jigs and Reels Lane." It took us about four trips past that to remember to capture that one. On top of all, this was close to one of the most beautiful places we've visited in Canada itself. It was food for the soul indeed.
Gàidhlig at the Herring Choker

One of the pre-arranged events was a meetup with Angus MacLeod, a man who teaches at the Gaelic College in St. Ann's college, for a Gàidhlig conversation. There were a couple of scheduling snafus to work through but eventually an appointment was made to meet at a restaurant west of Baddeck called "The Herring Choker", yes, "The Herring Choker." All humor aside, this restaurant has a (well deserved) reputation as providing the best food in the area. Angus had with him two ladies, one of them who is 101 bliadhna a dh'aois 101 years old who is originally from Assynt north of Ullapool in Scotland's northwest coast. Her daughter in law was with her as well. She has a wee bit of Gàidhlig left yet but it has rather leaked out over her years in Canada and as she puts it, "It's hard to understand the schoolbook Gàidhlig that so many have these days." I commiserated with her as though there have been a number who have called me fluent through the years, I well know I speak with an awful mix of an Oregon accent with bits from the Isle of Harris thrown in for good measure. Having said that, the ladies enjoyed my interactions with Angus. The older lady I was sitting next to had an interesting tale of going back to Assynt in the 1980s and being welcomed back home as a long lost relative though even at that time she had been away from Scotland for decades. It reminded me of a similar scene set in the Book "No Great Mischief" written by a fellow Caper and author, Alasdair MacLeod.

In addition to also visiting the Gaelic College, we visited The Highland Village (museum) in Iona, another small town in Cape Breton that has a place name from Gàidhealtachd regions in Scotland. It was interesting to see the physical history of Highland settlers on Cape Breton but I must admit to a certain disappointment with the presenters. They only had a limited amount of Gàidhlig, just enough to give their presentations some flavor but when I attempted conversations with them, my "schoolbook Gàidhlig" outstripped theirs often within a minute. However, a presenter in the house that was built a generation or so past in the 1800s had a bit more and explained some of the local flavor on the Gàidhlig in the area, for example, an "l" sound is often replaced with a "w" sound.

One of the last major events we visited was a family square dance in West Mabou, Saturday night. People from all ages attend this, mostly locals though there were a few of us tourists there, a few from our B & B and ourselves. Now for those readers who thinks a square dance means something like you might have experienced in grade school or you've attended one locally, what Capers call a square dance is rather different. It is more like an Irish ceilidh dance with the admixture of step dancing. A couple of poor quality videos that I took on my cell phone of that can be seen here:
