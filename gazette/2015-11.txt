Scottish Country Dancing in the 21st century has many advantages. Sit down at a
computer or with a tablet and you can connect to websites and YouTube videos
that contain anything you want to know about dancing. 

For instance, November’s monthly party coming up and let’s say you can’t
remember what dances are on the program? Go to our website and there is a list
of all the dances. And Darrick, our website manager has also included links to
videos of the dances so you can see them danced.

Are you interested in the history of Scottish Country Dancing? There are
websites that will tell you all about Miss Milligan and Mrs. Stewart and how
they started the Scottish Country Dance Society. You can even find history that
goes back even further.

Here is a list of websites you might find fun to look at.
Our branch website: http://portlandscottishdancers.org/
Southwest Washington State Branch (Vancouver) website: http://vancouverusa-scd.org/
The Royal Scottish Country Dance Society’s website: http://www.rscds.org/

If you want to know the directions of a dance, check out Linda Mae’s
Danciemaetion site: http://danciemaetion.imaginationprocessing.com/ . Or search
for a dance by title in YouTube and you may just find a group somewhere in the
world that has uploaded a video.

Some websites have tons of information and links to more websites. Try looking at:
http://strathspey.org/ and http://scottishdance.net/scd/ .

And then there are individual dance group websites. Say you’re going to Boston
for a vacation and want to do some dancing. You can search for “Scottish
country dancing Boston” on your computer and up pops “Boston Branch, RSCDS”.

I have bookmarked many of these sites on my computer. 

So, if you have a little bit of time try looking at these websites. It’s a lot
of fun seeing what is out there, and there’s a lot to learn.
