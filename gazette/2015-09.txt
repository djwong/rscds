Welcome back to the new dance year! I’m sure all our feet are itching to get
moving after the long, hot and dry summer hiatus. We’ll be starting again
Monday, September 14th with easy dances and frozen juice bars afterwards to
kick off the new dance year. 

Many thanks to Lisa Scott, Randy Lewis, Susan Gere, and the Portland Scottish
Country Dance Society Board, http://portlandcountrydance.org/, we now have a
new venue at Burlingame Water Tower Dance Hall! It is a beautiful facility
located in an older Portland neighborhood called Capitol Hill.  Please see
below some photos of the venue.  This location solved two problems, one of cost
and a more centralized location. As a consequence, we will be having our
Saturday dances there as well instead of at Renaissance School. Our new venue
has a downstairs location for snacks and socializing.

[[http://portlandscottishdancers.org/classes.html|Here]] is a map to the new venue.
For those who navigate better with written directions, please see as follows:
“The address is 8936 SW 17th, Portland, OR 97219. From the North, head South on
I-5. Take the Barbur Blvd. exit, Number 296A, and turn right. Turn right onto
SW Spring Garden Street. Turn right onto 17th Avenue and look for the dance
hall near the top of the hill (on the north side of 17th.) From the South, head
North on I-5. Take the Taylors Ferry exit, number 295, and keep left at the
fork in the ramp. Merge onto Taylors Ferry, turn left on 17th Avenue and look
for the dance hall near the top of the hill.  To put it another way, don’t come
to Waluga Lodge as we won’t  be dancing there! 

We will likely have some interaction with the English and Contra dance
community which will give us opportunity to make some new friends, learn some
news styles of dancing, and possibly add to our numbers.

Coming up will be Fort Worden’s workshop and ball on September 11-12
(http://www.rscds-seattle.org/ftworden/), then the Bend – Redmond workshop and
ball on October 3rd (http://www.hdccd.com/) and our own Portland workshop and
ball on March 12, 2016, as well as monthly dances. Information for that can be
found at http://portlandscottishdancers.org.

I look forward to seeing all your smiling faces!

Greetings dancers!

As I sit down to write this, it’s our second rainy afternoon since June. Does
it mean this long, hot summer is coming to a close? Perhaps. The pears are
definitely falling out of the pear tree, and the grapes have begun turning from
green to purple – all sure signs of a changing season.  *Back to Dance* week
will be upon us before we know it!

Here are some statistics that I found on a website called http://www.enthusiasmexperiment.com/.

 * 57% of people chat more online than they do in real life.
 * Our attention span has dropped by 40% since 2000.
 * 1 out of 8 Americans are social media addicts.
 * Children ages 12 to 18 spend nearly two hours a day texting alone.
 * 8 to 10 year olds average almost 8 hours a day of screen time.
 * 11 to 18 year olds spend more than 11 hours per day of screen time.
 * The current divorce rate is about 43% for first time marriages.
 * The new communication “normal” is little to no eye contact during conversation while people “multitask” on mobile devices.

The website has more to do with children with autism than dancing, and I’m not
endorsing it one way or the other, but the statistics are worth paying
attention to. 

We are so lucky to have Scottish Country Dancing in our lives. For at least a
few hours a week we are truly engaged with other people, with fabulous music,
and with movement. And that combination keeps our brains, bodies, and psyches
beautifully healthy. We get to do this “therapy” every week of the year with
the exception of a few weeks in the summer which apparently only serve to
remind us how much we miss our weekly face time with friends and how much we
enjoy dancing. Dancing is so refreshing, so relaxing, and so much fun! And yet,
the joys of Scottish Country Dancing – even Scottish Country Dancing itself
remains unknown to 90% of the population. People just don’t know what it is.

I believe word of mouth is the best way to get people dancing. We all need to
take every opportunity to let people know about Scottish Country Dancing. It
takes some self-confidence to approach everyone you know or meet as not just a
person, but as an enthusiastic Scottish Country Dancer. I am very guilty of not
being prepared for and taking every opportunity, myself. But I want people to
chat in real life more than they do online, I want people to be able to pay
attention, I want children and young adults to be able to communicate face to
face – to be able to have eye-contact and not feel weird about it, and I want
couples to be able to communicate and have fun together. 

So as we start this dancing year, I hope that you will join me in trying to
communicate our joy in dancing to as many other people as you come in contact
with, and bring them to dance class. Bring them using your enthusiasm, your
joy, your love of dancing. 

See you in September. Bring buddies!

How did you spend your summer? I spent part of mine in Farmville! No… not the
Facebook game. :-) There's actually a town called Farmville in Virginia,
U.S.A., believe it or not. Apparently, it was big on growing tobacco in its
early days—but I won't go into that right now. I also happen to know there's a
perfectly good explanation for why there is a university in Farmville,
Virginia, population 8216, (saaaaalllutte!) but I won't expound upon that,
either. Suffice to say, TAC (Teachers Association of Canada) discovered
Longwood University and decided it would be a good location for 2015 Summer
School!

Most readers of this article know that TAC Summer School is not about bookwork;
rather, it is about footwork—and fun for the avid Scottish Country dancer. I
was first exposed to TAC three years ago when they came to Portland State
University, and I was among the locals asked to “stooge” for the prospective
teachers. We were given to understand that we were to be honest in our dancing
abilities to provide the most realistic teaching possibilities for the
candidates. That actually took some pressure off of me, as I still had a lot to
learn back then.

Hmm, did I say, “back then”? Oh well. :-) The following year, several of our
local dancers, including my husband, Martin, decided to go to Summer School at
Mount Allison University in New Brunswick, in the maritimes provinces of
Canada. They had such a good time, and I have made a wee bit of progress since
then and upon earlier this year I received an email promoting TAC in Virginia,
I was inclined to make a go of it. Martin was not averse to tackling TAC again,
so come July 26, we found ourselves on a shuttle from Richmond airport with
other students, bumping our way to Longwood University. Little did we know that
one of the “students” was actually Etienne Ozorak, one of our accordion
musicians! We also discovered later, that he and his wife, Cheri, are amazing
ballroom dancers!

Between the dearth of sleep we owned, and a missing garment bag we apparently
didn't own, I was kind of “shell-shocked”, but Gail Michener, Sandy Garraway,
and Fiona Miller among others, were on hand to welcome us.

It was enjoyable and fascinating meeting fellow students. As Martin said to me,
“Attending TAC is like traveling all over the world without actually going.”
There were people from United States, England, Scotland, Canada, Australia,
France and Switzerland, for starters! There were so many diverse accents being
used that on more than one occasion I couldn't resist rolling my “r”s. One day,
I was the gleeful recipient of a ride from Curry Hall to the Dining Hall. Dave
“Mr. Fiona” (married to Fiona Miller, Summer School Director), who was our
“Jeeves”, driving the university-provided golf cart around heard me trolling,
and asked where I was from. “Orrregon”, I replied.

The morning classes were personalized by dancing preferences and abilities and
identified by local trees: Sassafras (Advanced), Mulberry (Social), Hickory
(Intermediate) and Tupelo. Martin was not a suffering Sassafras. Some of you
know that Martin dealt for over a year with plantar fasciitis, and he more than
half-expected to “feel the pain” with the rigorous course, but apparently he is
healed!! I really enjoyed being a Mulberry. People were so friendly,
complimentary and patient with me. We were taught social aspects of dancing,
especially from the waist up; most of the students had various physical
challenges that kept them from being able to do the fancy footwork. Be sure to
smile, look like you are enjoying yourself! It was also fun having Marge van
Nus in my class! The teachers were Rebecca Blackhall-Peters, Langley, BC; Terry
Harvey Newton Square, PA, USA; Robert McOwen, Arlington, MA, USA; Sue Porter
Oban, Scotland, UK. They all traded off teaching the different levels. Here is
a link to the dances taught to each group:

It was a treat having live music for the classes every day! Speaking of
musicians, we had some wonderful, talented performers: Kathy Fraser-Collins,
Glen Andrew, ON, Canada, music director and keyboard; Neil Barron Wetherby,
West Yorkshire, England, UK on accordion; Fred Collins on the drums, Glen
Andrew, ON, Canada; Judi Nicolson, Katy, TX, USA on fiddle; Etienne Ozorak
Sacramento, CA, USA on accordion; Don Wood, Aurora, ON, Canada on keyboards.
The music was incredible!

The afternoons provided opportunities to learn different dance genres and
techniques, but I decided I would benefit most from the dance/ball walkthrough
classes. Martin, being the nice guy he is, attended with me. One of the
teachers for the walk-through classes will be known by the long-term dancers
from the Portland, OR Branch: Lin (aka Linda) Pettigill. She earned her
teaching certificate as a Portland member. Sadly (for us), right after she got
certified, her husband got a job and they moved to California; some of you may
know her from Asilomar.

Wednesday had no regular classes because it was field trip day! Some either
went hiking on the High Bridge Trail nearby or toured Monticello, the famous
home of Thomas Jefferson. There were dances almost every night, Sunday through
Tuesday. Thursday, Wednesday and Friday evenings had ceilidhs. Saturday had the
banquet and Ball! There were after parties (almost?) every night on the first
floor of Curry Hall. Some after parties were mostly chatting and enjoying food
and drink; others consisted of people getting their second (or third) wind!
Sometimes the musician's music inspired a lot of creative moves and dancing!
What tune was it that Sue Porter kept dancing the “Macarena” moves to? I was
frankly amazed at the energy displayed/demonstrated by people after long days
of combined dancing and humidity. (To be fair, there were some that would find
soothing relief at one of the water fountains on the way “home” after a dance.
Daily (or nightly), Martin verbally counted the bathers: 4,4,4,5,6,18! After
the Ball, there were people who actually swam in it!)

I have likely “jacked” too much space, but there was so much to say! I was
amazed at the noisy cicadas, which I originally thought were automatic
sprinklers. :-) The tree frogs were abundantly ever present. And, we actually
spied some fireflies! I must share appreciation for the friendliness and
conviviality of the Longwood staff! I also want to publicly thank student Maria
Ward for her kindness in using her car and time to take Martin and me shopping
so we could avoid the humidity and find some clothing suitable for the Ball!

In closing, I would like it to be known that attending TAC Summer School is a
fun, valuable and worthwhile experience!

(As husband to the writer of this article, I want to express a sincere thank
you to everyone who treated Eunice and I with such kindness at TAC Summer
School! For those who might be considering this another year but are unsure,
know that at whatever level you are you will learn something and have a
wonderful experience immersing yourself in Scottish dance and culture. ~ The
President)
