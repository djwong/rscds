== Note From Maureen Sloan ==
by Maureen Sloan

'''M'''any thanks to all of you who came to Gertz’s to wish me a happy retirement from dancing.  It was so good to see so many of you again - and also, so many former dancers.  It was a good opportunity for reminiscing, especially with the old club photo books there to refresh our memories. It was fun, even though I didn’t really need to see a picture of myself as “Haste to the Wedding” in very short shorts, running shoes, sporting a wedding veil as headdress!! But it reminded me that back in the day, the dance club was the center of our social life -  what with Monday classes, Saturday dances, demo team performances, Burns' nights, Highland Games, we were kept plenty busy. 

I have enjoyed my many years of Scottish Country dancing - I first joined in 1981, when the Portland Branch was in it’s early stages of formation.  I've probably held most every position on the Board at one time or another.  It’s all been great fun and very rewarding, but  the time comes for all of us when we have to finally hang up our ghillies, and that time has come for me. I've been rather proud of the fact that I outlasted all my contemporaries, with the notable exception of Don Gertz (who I'm sure will never retire), but as you all know I had a long drive to get to class, so reluctantly I must call it a day.

Someone suggested that I should call in to the Workshop to see how you’re all doing - so maybe I will do just that. Anyway - many, many thanks to Don and Linda for putting on the party and giving us all the opportunity to get together.  I had a great time, and the goodies were very tasty (what would a Scottish dance party be without munchies!) - thank you Linda. So with a wish to you all to keep dancing, I'll say “adieu” and thanks for all the happy memories.

A demonstration team, the Eugene Scottish Country Dancers, performed at the games, to the delight of many.   We danced the Sailor, Roaring Jelly, Byron Strathspey, Dave Nick Nack, and Mairi’s Wedding.  The team had a great time. This was held at Bob Keefer Center For Sports & Recreation.

'''Friday, June 23'''

'''W'''e got up the next morning, had a bit of breakfast, and went to find that pesky castle. Holly guided us there. It had rained overnight, and was still pretty cool and windy, but we did find the castle – a fairly modern and privately-owned sort of manor house – as well as more carved stumps, and saw a lot of people out walking their dogs. Very enjoyable.
We checked out of the Inn, and walked another very enjoyable five miles along the beautifully maintained footpath beside the River Leven – very clear and fast moving – from Loch Lomond to Dumbarton. We stopped at the first pub we came to, as we were all ready for some lunch. It was called the Glen Cairn Lounge, and it was absolutely packed, even though it was well after 1:00pm. We decided we would rather do sight-seeing without our packs, so made our way to the east end of town to the Dumbuck Hotel before proceeding. The Dumbuck is very old, with odd hills and valleys in the floor. We got checked in and were taking a wee rest when Holly knocked on our door to inform us that the castle was going to close at 5:30 and she was headed that way. We debated for a moment or two before deciding we would take the bus to get closer to the castle. Sally opted for a nap.
The bus only took us 3 stops closer to the castle, which was still a good long walk once we got off the bus. But it was totally worth the effort. Dumbarton Castle sits on top of a large hill overlooking the Leven and the Clyde Rivers. It was a long walk up to the top, and it was super windy up there, but we were impressed with fabulous views from the top, and by the historical significance of the location. We caught up with Holly at the top, but didn’t see her for long, as she was off again in pursuit of the great photo. We agreed to walk back to the Hotel, since the bus hadn’t really done us that much good. We all had dinner together at the hotel restaurant, played a game of Quiddler, and went to bed.

'''Saturday, June 24'''

Saturday morning we walked to the train station and caught the 9:13 train to Glasgow. The weather had turned quite cold and windy. We got off the train at Hyndland station and walked about 2.5 miles through the University district, admiring all the cool architecture, to the Botanic Gardens. At the gardens we scattered, and spent a couple of delightful hours communing with the plants. 
At noon, we met up with Muriel Bone, the chair of the Glasgow Branch of the RSCDS, and she brought a few members of the Executive Committee with her, Helen (the quiet), Helen (the well-travelled), and Penelope. We all went to lunch together in a converted ancient church. We sat at a long table with the two groups completely mixed, so everyone had a different lunch experience depending on who they were sitting next to, but it was a lively, social lunch. We were invited (pressured?) to a dance that evening, but as there was three hours of travel involved, the program was unfamiliar, and the dances would not be briefed, we eventually declined. We were unable to look at any more of the church because there was a wedding going on, so after pictures together, we said our goodbyes to Penelope and the Helen’s. Then Muriel took us on an amazing tour of the University – she actually went to University there and was a wealth of knowledge, taking us around the entire campus. Unfortunately, we were unable to see the Great Hall because of another wedding. We did get to see the Mackintosh House, which was a bit disappointing, as there wasn’t as much to it as I had hoped, but still cool, because… Mackintosh! 
We said our goodbyes to Muriel, who kindly pointed us in the right direction through Kelvingrove Park, and headed off. On the way, we decided to skip the Kelvingrove Museum, as we had been carrying packs for the better part of the day, and had been well museumed by then. We stopped for a moment in the park, distracted by ‘something’ going on – men in matching kilts hanging about, and boys in matching outfits getting lined up on risers on a stage. We were invited in by one of the security guards, and informed that it was a choir competition. We watched from outside for a few more disorganized minutes, but only heard the angelic voices of the boys choir in the distance as we wandered forth.
We found our way to the Hampton Court Guesthouse, which sounds FAR grander than it actually was. It was among a block of similar guesthouses with similarly grand names – Othello’s, Ophelia’s, etc. We were shown to our two rooms in the basement with a shared bath (and a funny smell). The rooms were tiny, and the lot summarily renamed “The Dungeon”. It was clean, though, and we weren’t there for the great accommodations. We got settled and ventured out to Sauchie Hall Street, bustling on a Saturday evening, and a bit more exciting than we really wanted. We continued on toward the George Square area, where it was a bit more touristy and low key. We decided on Molly Malone’s for dinner (something Irish, instead of the usual Scottish fare). The food was quite good. Sally said that was the best dinner she had had so far. On the way back to the Guesthouse, we stopped at the store for some supplies, but were happy to settle into the Dungeon for the night and not participate in the Glasgow Saturday night life. More Quiddler, too!

'''Sunday, June 25'''

We had a nice breakfast at the Guesthouse, and ventured out again. We retraced our steps from the previous evening, this time walking all the way to George Square through the still sleeping city, seeing evidence of the fun that was had he night before. We appreciated the statues in George Square, made our way to the River Clyde, and walked along first the north bank, and then crossed on a foot bridge to the south bank, where it is a whole different world. The immigrants, it seems have all settled south of the river. There were lots of small flats, grit, no lawns, or really plants at all, and lots of small shops with signs in languages that I don’t know. We walked to the Science Museum, which turned out to be rather geared toward children, and with a pretty steep entrance fee. There was a Starbuck’s on the property though, so we stopped in to enjoy a cup of coffee (or mocha, yum!) out of the cold and wind. 
There was an observation tower that we wanted to go up on, but if the wind speed at ground level was more than 25 mph, and it was, the tower was closed. We observed that it must be closed a lot, and the museum official we were talking to said, “No comment.” So, bummer.
Off we went again, suffering through the high winds to our next stop, the GoGlasgow Urban Hotel. It was like an oasis! The rooms were light and spacious, the beds comfortable, the towels big and fluffy! Everyone had a wee nap when we got there. We decided we needed a bite to eat before sight-seeing, which was a bit of a mistake, because it took almost an hour to get a bowl of soup! 
On the schedule it said we were supposed to go to the Pollock House, but our first stop was at the House for an Art Lover in Bellahouston Park. This Park celebrates all forms of art and was very cool! Unfortunately, at the House for an Art Lover they were having, you guessed it, a wedding, so all we got to do was shop in the gift shop and envy the people who were enjoying lunch in the little café. If only we had known. We wandered through the gardens a bit together, then Holly and Sally went off to find the Walled Garden, and Patrick and I sauntered among the statues on the grounds until we decided that what we really needed was an attitude adjustment. Lots of places are closed on Sunday in Glasgow, and eventually, after being rained upon slightly, we found ourselves back at the hotel. We had a lovely beverage at the hotel bar. Then, not wanting to repeat the lunch fiasco, but very much wanting nothing more than to hang out in our beautiful room, we went down to the local Co-Op and bought groceries for our dinner. We took them back to our room and snacked heartily while alternately watching TV and snoozing on the comfy bed. Holly and Sally had a similar ‘evening at home’. 

'''Monday, June 26'''

On Monday morning we were much restored and off walking again, headed for Paisley. It was a nice morning for walking, and although we were in morning traffic for awhile and dodging Mom’s trying to get their weekend-addled children to school, eventually, we got onto a footpath through the woods along a creek called The White Cart Water. This brought us into Paisley and to the Watermill Hotel. They allowed us early check-in, so we were able to ditch the packs, and once again had to wait a good long time for our lunch, but it was deliciously worth the wait! After lunch we explored Paisley. It’s a lovely little town with a lot of good history, which seems largely unappreciated now – very few tourists. The abbey was marvelous. The museum, unfortunately, was closed on Mondays, as were many restaurants. But the architecture was excellent, and the feel was of a friendly, small town.
After a consultation with the map, Holly decided she had to go back the 3.5 miles to find the ruins of a walled castle that we had accidentally bypassed on our morning walk. Sally, Patrick, and I went to see if we could actually cross the rail yard where Google said we could so that we could walk to the airport the next morning. Once we had determined that we could indeed cross the tracks, we found the most interesting part of town to wander through, and within it, a most quaint and charming pub, The Steershead, which we could not resist going into. We met Holly back at the hotel at 5:00pm, got cleaned up and headed out for our last dinner together. To make it memorable, we opted for Indian food at Multan Tandoori. The food was excellent, but there was WAY too much of it. We took what we could with us, but regretfully had to leave much of it behind. There was another pub Patrick wanted to go to after dinner called Kennedy’s. Patrick, Sally, and I went to the pub, while Holly, taking advantage of the evening light, went to take pictures. Back at the hotel, I went over to Holly and Sally’s room for a last game of Quiddler, and when I came back, Patrick was sound asleep “watching” a movie on his phone. Seemed like a good idea – sleep.

'''Tuesday, June 27'''

Tuesday morning, our last morning, was very rainy. Sally and Holly went over to the Abbey gift shop to pick up a few remaining items. Patrick and I arranged for a taxi to the airport. It would have been nice to do the final walk, but perhaps not so nice to sit on an airplane for 12 hours in wet clothes. We also observed that it might have been difficult to walk to the terminal building, as there was all kinds of crazy traffic that we would have had to go through and no sidewalks. 
Sally was so happy to check her pack at the airport.
The flight to Reykjavik was uneventful. We did, once again, park out in the middle of nowhere and took a bus to the terminal. The terminal was very full of people, and there were not enough chairs for everyone. We stood around for almost an hour, until they announced that our flight was going to be delayed for an hour. Then we sat on the floor for another hour, watching other people board their planes, until they announced that our flight was delayed for another hour. Then they told us we could have food vouchers, and that, by the way, our flight was delayed for another 3 hours. By this time, the people on our flight pretty much had the whole terminal building to ourselves. There was plenty of room for everyone to sit, or walk around, or take up three seats for a nap, or, if you were an exhausted toddler unable to go to sleep, have a complete meltdown.
Finally, we got a plane at 10:00pm, and flew in brilliant sunshine for 7 hours to arrive in Portland at 11:00ish. We shuffled through customs. Patrick and I were anxious to get out, so said our goodbyes and high-fives to Holly and Sally while they were waiting for their luggage. Then we exited the customs area and What?! We had to get on a bus to go to the actual terminal! I thought it was hilarious, and I’m sure Holly would have been laughing with me if she had been there. 
Janice was waiting for us at the gate, along with Martin, who said he couldn’t sleep, so just came to be a greeter. We left him there to greet Sally and Holly, who had their own arrangements for transport, and gratefully allowed Janice to drive us home. It’s good to be home.

'''Wha’s Like Us - Damn Few And They’re A’ Deid'''

The average Englishman, in the home he calls his castle, slips into his national costume, a shabby raincoat, patented by chemist Charles Macintosh from Glasgow, Scotland. En route to his office he strides along the English lane, surfaced by John Macadam of Ayr, Scotland. He drives an English car fitted with tyres invented by John Boyd Dunlop of Dreghorn, Scotland, arrives at the station and boards a train, the forerunner of which was a steam engine, invented by James Watt of Greenock, Scotland.He then pours himself a cup of coffee from a thermos flask, the latter invented by Dewar, a Scotsman from Kincardine-on-Forth.

At the office he receives the mail bearing adhesive stamps invented by James Chalmers of Dundee, Scotland. During the day he uses the telephone invented by Alexander Graham Bell, born in Edinburgh, Scotland. At home in the evening his daughter pedals her bicycle invented by Kirkpatrick Macmillan, blacksmith of Dumfries, Scotland. He watches the news on his television, an invention of John Logie Baird of Helensburgh, Scotland, and hears an item about the U.S. Navy, founded by John Paul Jones of Kirkbean, Scotland.

He has by now been reminded too much of Scotland and in desperation he picks up the Bible only to find that the first man mentioned in the good book is a Scot, King James VI, who authorised its translation. Nowhere can an Englishman turn to escape the ingenuity of the Scots. He could take to drink, but the Scots make the best in the world. He could take a rifle and end it all but the breech-loading rifle was invented by Captain Patrick of Pitfours, Scotland. If he escapes death, he might then find himself on an operating table injected with penicillin, which was discovered by Alexander Fleming of Darvel, Scotland, and given an anaesthetic, which was discovered by Sir James Young Simpson of Bathgate, Scotland. Out of the anaesthetic, he would find no comfort in learning he was as safe as the Bank of England founded by William Paterson of Dumfries, Scotland.

Perhaps his only remaining hope would be to get a transfusion of guid Scottish blood which would entitle him to ask, “Wha’s Like Us?”

Alisdair Biggar, a Scotsman, applied to join the New York City police force.  The hiring inspector glared at him and asked, ‘How would you disperse a large, unruly crowd?’ ‘Well,’ replied Alisdair thoughtfully, ‘I’m no too sure how ye do it here in New York. But in Aberdeen we just pass the hat around, and they soon begin to shuffle off.’
