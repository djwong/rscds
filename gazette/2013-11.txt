== President's Message ==
by Linda Gertz

November is here & that means time for Scottish Rose to play for our
November dance.  In case you don't know, the members are part of the
Portland Scottish Fiddle group.  They are led by our extremely capable
Cynthia Soo Hoo, who plays piano with the group.  Those who missed last
year's November party missed some great music.  I'm sure this year will be
just at great.  So plan to be there Saturday, November 9th at 7:30 pm!  

December will be here before we know it.  For the December party we are
planning to have a contest based on dressing as your favorite Christmas
carol.  The choices of what to dress up as range from "Grandma Got Run Over
by a Reindeer" to "Silent Night" to name just two.  So it should be a fun
party to see what people come up with.  We have some fun times ahead of us
and I hope you will be a part of the fun.  If you are interested in helping
out for either of these events, just let me know.  The more involved the
merrier!

We're so lucky! One great thing about fall is it promises lots of great
dancing opportunities. We are so lucky to have found a form of exercise that
is so much fun, and that we can do even when the days are short and the
weather is iffy. This is the time of year when we transition from nice long
days and moving around in the light to short, often rainy days that close
down into darkness way too soon. Many days, the sun seems to barely get
above the horizon, lingers behind the clouds for a few hours and then
suddenly, it's dark again. There's a temptation to hibernate. But don't
succumb!

This is the time of year when dancing becomes most important. Even if you
have to drag yourself out of the house by the collar, come dancing! Moving
around makes everyone feel so much better. Chatting and laughing with
friends is so beneficial to your overall health. I always, and without
exception, feel better after dance class than before, and I think you will
too. 

We're also so lucky to have such a great group of people to dance with. I
still marvel at the dedication of the intermediate dancers to get to class
on time, and be so willing to dance helpfully with beginning dancers. There
are many groups where the intermediate dancers are less than patient, and
don't want to be bothered dancing *easy* dances that they feel are beneath
them. Perhaps it's not so much luck as culture in this group, but it sure is
great!

So even if you have to really talk yourself into it, dance at every
opportunity through the fall and winter months, and appreciate all the
wonderful and diverse dancers you know. And keep in mind this quote from
Edwin Denby: "There is a bit of insanity in dancing that does everybody a
great deal of good."

It's Bizarre Bazaar Time!

At our November Party we will hold the "Bizarre Bazaar" as a fund raiser for
our workshop and ball.  For this event we ask you to clean out your closet,
shelves & wherever else these treasures may be, to bring your treasures to
sell at the Bizarre Bazaar.  Things like the gift from Aunt Mabel that she
thought was perfect for you, but isn't!  Other things might include, but are
not limited to:  Books, DVD's, CD's, toys, decorations, jewelry, plants,
food, pictures, art work, more food.  In other words, bring anything you no
longer want or something you wish to donate that you think someone else
might want!

== A Study in Tartan ==
by Molly Mc Friday

Ladies and gentlemen, the story you are about to read is true. The names
have been changed to protect the innocent.

In writing about Ft. Worden in the past, the usual procedure has been to
review the day's events, talk about how fantastic the music was, and how
much fun everyone had. This year's report is a little different. Instead of
just saying everyone had a lot of fun, here's a short anecdote to illustrate
how those in attendance did not want to leave because they were enjoying the
dancing and music too much. Remember that all names used are aliases and any
resemblance to their real names is purely coincidental.

This is Ft. Worden. This is where we dance, we are Scottish Country dancers.
The scene is Sunday morning in Erickson Hall, where the evening dances and
Sunday morning class are held. Sunday morning is a time when everyone limps
out on the floor for one more session, and each of the four teachers from
the weekend teaches at least one dance. 

Several of the Portland/Southwest Washington contingent were quite happy to
sit on the sidelines, enjoy the music (an absolutely heavenly sound provided
by Waverley Station), and watch everyone else dance. One of the group who
had been dancing, Ron, came over and asked those who were sitting when they
wanted to leave. He didn't want them to be bored while the others were
having fun dancing. As is usually the case, there was a lot of background
noise and Ron did not hear Lindy's response that sitting and listening was
quite pleasant and there was no hurry, nor did he hear her question asking
for the name of the last dance. 

Instead, Ron heard "We're enjoying the music and we can stay until the last
dance." With a gleeful look akin to that of a small boy who's just been told
he can play baseball as long as he wants and doesn't have to do his
homework, Ron ran back to his partner in the set. At this point, Sandra came
over and wanted to know why Ron was dancing again. He ran back over from the
set and said, "They" (indicating those sitting) "said it was fine to stay
until the last dance." To which Lindy said, "No that's not what I said. I
said 'what was the name of the last dance?'." By this point Ron had to stay
and dance (rats!), and then the group stayed for one more dance after that.
Some of us, who shall remain nameless (fake or otherwise) would have been
happy to stay until the very end, but all good things must come to an end
and it was time for the coach to turn back into a pumpkin and return to real
life. Until next year, that is.

The most recent dance party we had in Lake Oswego was a themed party, "Come
As A Dance." To be honest, I was terribly distracted most of the evening
thus much of it went by without much sticking in my memory but some rather
fantastical creations as you can see here. They were, as my kids would say,
awesome. If you want to see them all in action, please click the link:
