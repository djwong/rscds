== From The President ==
by Martin Mac​Kenzie

Note that our Annual Workshop and Ball is coming up this Saturday, March 14th,
2015! Our teachers will be Roberta Gotfried from Los Angeles, CA, Bob
Mc​Murtry from San Jose, CA and our musicians will be Deby Benton-Grosjean
from Aptos, CA and our very own Cynthia Soohoo from Portland, OR.

As we’re coming down the wire to our Workshop and Ball this Saturday, March
14th, I would like us to entertain certain thoughts as to how we might approach
this.

Some of you might have a bit of apprehension, as if facing a difficult class or
an important test in school. You might think that the consequences of failure
may be high. Yet, after all, this is just dancing, not space travel. I would
ask you to consider that everyone is there to learn, even the teachers learn
from that process. They might learn, for example, what methods and techniques
are more or less successful with different kinds of students with different
abilities and under different circumstances. Teachers may come with new ideas
they’ve learned from TAC (Teacher’s Association, Canada) or other courses
they’ve taken or workshops they’ve attended to help improve their craft. They
are highly invested in ensuring you have the best experience and in giving you
skills so that you can have the best time on the dance floor. Like every other
class in life, you might learn only a few things or many. Take it in stride and
enjoy the ebb and flow of it. Don’t be afraid to ask questions if you don’t
understand something or, ask for a demonstration or walk through if that
doesn’t help. The teachers won’t bite! It will do you a lot of good and you’ll
likely gain confidence by learning a new technique or finding a solution to a
step or figure you’ve struggled with.

Now the aforementioned is more geared to the workshop itself. After the
Workshop, we’ll gear up in all our finery and head back to the Ball itself.
Using the metaphor of school, this might also seem more like an exam or test.
However, it is patently not! It is a chance to enjoy what we’ve learned but
especially to interact with others at the dance. Most all of us will be locals
but there are many coming from out of town - long time friends or recent
acquaintances. Make it a point to dance with as many of them as possible, even
if that means not dancing with a dancer locally that you often enjoy dancing
with. This will help them feel welcome and foster connections between our dance
groups and branches. From my experience attending classes throughout the
country, it can be an incredibly enjoyable experience to meet and dance with
different folks and, this gives you an easy entre to attend their dances and
workshops in return. And please, turn your ears to the world class musicians
who provide the flight and sustenance to your dancing. Thank them for their
skills and efforts when you have opportunity. Though they seem to not be the
center of what we do, they make our dancing wonderful and possible.

Happy Dancing Everyone! See you on the dance floor!

== Teacher’s Corner ==
by Don Gertz

We’ve been working on reels of three in class lately and I’d like to share a
few hints that you may find helpful.

Reels of three have many variations (on the side, across the dance, 8 bar, 6
bar, mirror, right shoulder, left shoulder, etc. etc.) and are an integral part
of Scottish Country Dancing.

The basic reel of three is done on your own side of the dance with 1st, 2nd and
3rd couples. Unless otherwise specified, it begins with the 1st and 2nd person
passing right shoulders (moving to their Left) and the 3rd person dancing to
their Right to weave a figure 8 in 8 bars.

{{{#!html
<img src="../images/gg_mar_2015_0.jpg" alt="Reels of 3 on sides" width="384" height="489"/>
}}}

General Hints:
 1. Anticipate the start by turning towards your dancing direction just before the end of the previous phrase (i.e. bar 8).
 2. The order of passing through 2nd place is: 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2.
 3. At the end of bar 4 you should be either at the opposite end or back in 2nd place facing the other end.
 4. Making definite curves will help make sure that you are curving the correct direction at either end.
 5. Take the short route into place at the end of bar 8. No extra loops unless specified in the dance.

Reels of three across the dance are done the same way as the basic reel of
three, except that 1st couple begins in a line of three across the dance (often
1st W between 2nd couple and 1st M between 3rd couple). First couple often has
to finish with a longer step to end in a different position than they started
(i.e 2nd place opposite side in The Sailor).

Many reels of three are done with your corners after doing something else with
them. There are some general rules that can help you know which way to go.
These are often 6 bar reels with 1st couple crossing to 2nd place on their own
side on bars 7-8.

}}}

Reels of 3 after Turn Corners & Partner or Set to & turn corners:

 1.            1st couple passes Left shoulders with 1st corners by going out the end.
 2.            Corners dance Away from the center of the set at both ends (bars 1 and 4).
 3.            At the halfway point (end of bar 3 in a 6 bar reel) corners should be facing Out.
 4.            Making definite curves will help make sure that you are curving the correct direction at either end.
 5.            Take the short route into place at the end of bar 6. No extra loops unless specified in the dance.

{{{#!html
<img src="../images/gg_mar_2015_2.jpg" alt="Reels of 3 after set to corners" width="391" height="571"/>
}}}

Reels of three after Set to Corners or Set to Corners and Partner:

 1.            1st couple passes Right shoulders with 2nd corners by going out the end.
 2.            Corners dance Away from the center of the set at both ends (bars 1 and 4).
 3.            At the halfway point (end of bar 3 in a 6 bar reel) corners should be facing Out.
 4.            Making definite curves will help make sure that you are curving the correct direction at either end.
 5.            Take the short route into place at the end of bar 6. No extra loops unless specified in the dance.

You will notice that the corners always go out at both ends (bars 1 & 4) and
the 1st couple goes out the end when dancing reels of three with their corners.
The thing that WILL change is which corner goes through the center first and
that is whichever corner the 1st couple passes first.

I hope that these hints will help make understanding reels of three easier.

== WANTED:  New Branch Treasurer ==
by Pat Taylor

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

At the Annual Meeting in May, 2015 my already extended tenure as Portland
Branch treasurer will end. I know May seems a long way off, but I thought it
would be a good idea to give plenty of notice so that if anyone is interested,
I could begin to work with him/her after the 1st of the year.

This is not a difficult nor time-consuming position - in fact, I have enjoyed
it, and still am. I like working with figures because there’s only one right
answer, no debating!

These are the perks:
 * You get to work with really nice people.
 * You get the summers off!

These are the duties:

 * Provide sign-up sheets and collect the fees at Monday classes and Saturday parties. (It is not necessary to always be present if arrangements are made in advance for someone else to take the money)
 * Count and enter the amount collected in the appropriate fund in the ledger.
 * Deposit the funds - I usually do this at the end of each month.
 * Deposit checks for Demo Team performances.
 * Write rent checks to Waluga Lodge, St. Barnabas and the Saturday party venue.
 * Keep a record of teachers and write checks for them periodically.
 * Keep receipts for miscellaneous expenses and write checks for reimbursement.
 * Balance the checkbook against the bank statement monthly.
 * Create a monthly report of income/expenses - I have a spreadsheet for that.
 * Make various payments during the year, e.g. dues to Edinburgh, insurance, TAC memberships, publicity, Highland Games Association.
 * The busiest time of the year is, of course, around the Workshop & Ball when many checks have to be deposited and many expenses paid.
 * Attend Board meetings 3 or 4 times a year.

== Zero to Gaelic in Portland ==
by Martin Mac​Kenzie

As many of you know, I’ve a basic knowledge of the Ghàidhlig language which
I’ve learned over the years in concert with books, recordings, and the able
assistance of Donald Mac​Donald, a native son of the Island of Harris.
I’ve learned just today that Donald Mac​Donald is sadly now no longer with
us or, chaochail e, he passed away from the consequences of asbestosis which he
acquired working on refurbishing ships in his younger days in Glasgow
shipyards. His pages are being kept online by, I assume, a family member at
http://www3.sympatico.ca/donaldmacdonald/index.htm. I have, when time is
available, been trying to keep the language in my head and air mo theanchaidh
literally “on my tongue” through listening to Caithream Ciùil daily, a program
from Radio Nan Gaidheal, part of BBC Alba, the Scottish Gaelic service, which
can be heard at http://www.bbc.co.uk/radionangaidheal. I also keep a weekly
schedule over Skype with a former fellow student of Donald’s, Robert (Mac)
MacKenzie out of Calgary, Alberta Canada.

Saturday, February 21st of this year, I participated in an event hosted by
Slighe Nan Gaidheal, meaning the way of the Gael or Gaelic speaker, called
“Zero to Gaelic in Portland.” This was hosted by a familiar venue to many of
us, the Renaissance School of Arts and Sciences.
http://www.renaissanceschoolportland.org/. I signed up for the intermediate
level, though there was a range available from no Ghàidhlig at all, to
advanced. The atmosphere was quite relaxed thanks to the beautiful weather, the
excellent facilities, and the good and gentle hearts of those participating.
The latter, of its importance I can’t stress enough, is key to facilitating the
comfort level needed to ease the learning process. Before classes began, there
were greetings and a bit of socializing, a time of announcements, an outline of
classes, and assurances that the attendees would not be locked into a
particular level if any found either that they were in a class too advanced or
below for their abilities.

A program called “Language Hunters” was used to help facilitate learning. I’m
not aware if this method has been used with Scottish Gàidhlig though it is
generally used to help recover endangered languages from around the world. The
facilitator of this was Brían Ó hAirt, a teacher of Irish Gaelic in the
Portland area. It uses games and gestures to help cement the language in one’s
mind in ways that studying a language in a purely dry academic setting doesn’t
accomplish as effectively. http://languagehunters.org/ Seumus Gagne, the
director of Slighe Nan Gaidheal taught in the beginning level and a local man
named Geoff Frasier, whom some of us experienced leading a Burns Supper for the
Masonic Lodge in southeast Portland was the primary instructor for the
intermediate to advanced levels. Though he is only newly familiar with the
Language Hunters method of teaching, he was quite able in this rôle.

Though I found my abilities a bit above the level of my selected class, one
thing I found quite helpful and interesting was sung studying Gàidhlig. This
has been an obstacle for me as academic or spoken Gàidhlig is more bound to the
rules and grammar of the language while songs, òrain, don’t follow those rules
as rigidly and often use idioms and words that are not used in modern Gàidhlig.
We spent some time singing a common puirt a' beul, or mouth music tune named Cì
'n Fhidheall “Give Me The Fiddle.” The lyrics of this song were distributed
amongst the class members and in addition to reacquainting ourselves with the
tune, worked through the lyrics in such a way as to understand what is being
said literally, what parts of that were idomatic, used to maintain rhythmic
flow, used older words, or had grammatical connotations like genetive case
constructions and the like. Here is the tune, both in lyrical form and with
audio:
   
Cì 'n Fhidheall

[Sèisd (chorus):]
'S ò cì 'n fhidheall fair an fhidheall
Cì 'n fhidheall fair an fhidheall
Cì 'n fhidheall fair an fhidheall
Cuir an fhidheall air a' bhòrd.


[2 turas (times) :]
'S toigh leam Bean Thobhtaiche Dubha [x 3]
'S toigh leam piuthar Ràghnaill Oig.

Nighean Ràghnail Ruaidh thu [x 3]
'S piuthar ghuanach Ràghnaill Oig.

Chunna mi 'san Dùn thu [x 3]
Dèanamh cunntas ri Mac Leòid.
   

The tune is available here as part of a tune set in the version most familiar
to myself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WiFHLm5rpY

Now you have a little flavor of what it means when I say during a class that a
particular tune in a tune set in class is of Gàidhlig origins. Suas leis a'
Ghàidhlig! May Gàighlig be stronger!

== RSCDS Spring Fling Trialling ==
by Tom Halpenny

RSCDS invited Young Dance devisors to submit a dance that will be judged at the
upcoming 2015 Spring Fling event. Young devisors submitted 46 dances and they
are being trialled by 33 Young Dance groups from around the world, including:
Australia, New Zealand, Jamaica, Russia, Canada, America, Continental Europe
and the UK. The final short list of dances will be trialled in London at Spring
Fling 2015.

Branch teacher committee members Linda Mae and Liza taught six submitted dances
to our own group of young dancers on January 31: Josh, Antonya, Darrick,
Lilyana, Maggie, Caitlin, Elisabeth, and Holly. Dancers voted and commented on
the quality of each dance. The Branch was the first to submit trialling results
to RSCDS, before the March 15 deadline.

We can view the dancers in action. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzHRVrbVG0I

== Elspeth Gray Interview ==

== RSCDS Scotland Visit ==
by Tom Halpenny

I travelled to Edinburgh January 8-12 for meetings with the elite leaders of
the RSCDS world, for the Strategy session of the Management Board and the three
committees. The main goal of the meeting was to identify methods to increase
the number of Scottish country dancers worldwide, and indirectly to increase
the number of RSCDS members.

I arrived Friday morning and visited Headquarters at 12 Coates Crescent. I met
several staff whose names I had read over the years. I also met Mike Greenwood,
the new Digital Communications Officer, and we discussed some ideas for a
couple hours.

I departed HQ and walked to the nearby Tune Hotel to check in and take a nap.
My room had a compact space without windows, so I was easily able to fall
asleep. I awoke and departed into the 4:00pm dusk with street map in hand to
explore the neighborhood and find my way to the Radison Blu Hotel on the Royal
Mile, site of the next day's Strategy meeting. It was fascinating to wander
through the winding streets among the stone architecture buildings, and try to
recover after becoming lost, an important Scottish dance skill.

I headed out Saturday for an early morning walkabout, with Edinburgh Castle
centrally in view, and arrived early for the meeting. I enjoyed becoming
acquainted with everyone as they arrived, and I was able to talk with almost
all 35 attendees during the day. Raphaëlle Orgeret from France, Anselm Lingnau
from Germany, staff member Mike Greenwood from Canada, and myself from USA were
the four international attendees who spoke with an accent. After a short
meeting of the Management Board, the main meeting began. Chairman Jim Healy and
Chairman-Elect Helen Russell introduced the agenda, and the meeting divided
into five breakout groups who gathered ideas for one hour. After lunch, each
group reported its results.

Retiring Membership Secretary Elspeth Gray was on hand to record the meeting
notes. During lunch, Jim Healy presented Elspeth with a gift and gratitude from
the Society for Elspeth's contributions over the past 14 years. Six past
chairmen also attended, which contributed to the festivity.

At the conclusion of the meeting, everyone said their goodbyes and ventured
outdoors to observe that the dynamic weather had become breezy with showers. I
felt right at home, with weather similar to the Portland-Vancouver area.

With all the SCD teaching and music talent in the meeting, it would have been
fun for everyone to do some Scottish dancing. Moira Thomson informed me about
the Trinity Ball on Saturday evening. I was casually dressed for the occasion,
but I walked several miles to the ball location and observed the dancing. Event
organizers Colin and Joan Tyler welcomed me to observe the ten dancing sets and
band consisting of accordian "box", fiddle, and drums. I noticed four dancers
whom I had met earlier in the RSCDS Strategy meeting. I had a cordial
conversation with co-MC Margo Priestly, who described what it's like to teach
her advanced SCD class with the aid of a musician.

The dynamic weather continued Sunday as I headed out, after a hearty Scottish
breakfast, for a hike north to the Firth of Forth and Ocean Terminal. I
followed my street map and only became lost once. The route took me through the
Royal Botanical Garden that relocated to the current site around 1800 and is
maintained by a staff of 50 gardeners. I finally reached the water and took
refuge in a large shopping mall that is the site of the Royal Yacht Britania.
After sufficient rest, I returned to the hotel via double decker bus line
number 22.

I rode the tram from the hotel to the Edinburgh airport Monday morning and
boarded the airline for the trip home. All in all, a pleasant and memorable
three days of introduction to Edinburgh and RSCDS.
