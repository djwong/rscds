== From The President ==
by Martin​MacKenzie

As I wrote this, we’re leading up to the New Year holiday and then next week,
Monday, January 5th, we’ll be back at it dancing together with our smiling
faces, and probably a couple of extra pounds to work off as well!

I want to thank everyone who worked so hard on the Highland Fair, contributed
to that directly, and contributed things to sell. Thank you to our folks at our
current dance venue, Renaissance School of Arts and Sciences, for providing
such a nice venue to dance in and being so easy to work with.

In that vein, I would like to request that everyone keep their eyes open for
other venues, especially for our weekly dance classes as we may need to change
that for the next dance year.

Note that our workshop and ball is coming up this March 15th, 2015. You may
have received an announcement with the attached flyer from Linda Mae
encouraging everyone to sign up. Please do so, early and often! Our teachers
will be Roberta Gotfried from Los Angeles, CA, Bob Mc​Murtry from San Jose, CA
and our musicians will be Deby Benton-Grosjean from Aptos, CA and our very own
Cynthia Soohoo from Portland, OR.

Looking forward to seeing you on the dance floor!

== Teacher’s Corner ==
by Linda Mae Dennis

It is interesting to get to the end of a year, reflect on the past year, and
imagine what might be in the next year. The year, of course, is an arbitrary
invention of people, and while the seasons do come one after the other, there’s
really no reason that reflecting on the past year and attempting to predict the
next one couldn’t happen on some random day, like the last day of April. But,
tradition / civilization says this is the time, so that’s what we do.

I hope that each of you has a chance to think about the progress you’ve made in
your dancing this year. We are so fortunate to have Scottish Country Dancing as
a hobby. First of all, we can do it inside, and at this time of year, that’s a
wonderful thing. We also have a superb group of people to share our joy of
dancing with. And of course that extends to the wider world beyond Portland,
but the Portland dancers are really some of the nicest, most supportive,
helpful, and friendly of any groups of dancers I’ve had contact with.

The other thing about Scottish Country Dancing is there’s always some new way
to progress. You may spend several years getting the steps just right, and then
we want to teach you a whole new step! You think you know all the basic
figures, and then we do a dance with a figure you’ve never seen before, that
just blows your mind, or a new twist on a well-known figure that is equally
mind-blowing! Or a new dance that breaks all the rules but is amazing anyway!
It’s marvelous how creative Scottish Country Dancers are at coming up with new
and fabulous dances. (It’s unfortunate that we will never get to dance them all
– with over 13,000 dances available, and more coming every day, we just won’t
have the time.) And once the steps and figures are mastered, there’s the
ability to listen to a brief and do a dance. The ability to understand where
every person in your set should be simultaneously and give correct assistance
where needed. There’s the ability to ask intelligent questions, plus the
ability to correctly answer dancers’ questions about how things should be done
(not when the teacher is attempting to teach, of course!). And then there are
the Scottish customs, language, literature, music, and culture to be studied.
If that’s not enough, you could consider becoming a teacher – we teachers
aren’t getting any younger, and will need to be replaced eventually. And even
as a teacher, there is always more to learn, and more skills to try to master.

I hope that you all do reflect on the progress you’ve made in the past year. We
know it’s not easy, and we know it takes time, but it is so gratifying to see
the progress each of you has made. As teachers, we get such a thrill out of
seeing progress, and are so proud of ‘our’ dancers who struggle to improve, and
then succeed.

Keep working, keep trying, keep learning. Scottish Country Dancing is Awesome!

== WANTED:  New Branch Treasurer ==
by Pat Taylor

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

At the Annual Meeting in May, 2015 my already extended tenure as Portland
Branch treasurer will end. I know May seems a long way off, but I thought it
would be a good idea to give plenty of notice so that if anyone is interested,
I could begin to work with him/her after the 1st of the year.

This is not a difficult nor time-consuming position - in fact, I have enjoyed
it, and still am. I like working with figures because there’s only one right
answer, no debating!

These are the perks:
 * You get to work with really nice people.
 * You get the summers off!

These are the duties:

 * Provide sign-up sheets and collect the fees at Monday classes and Saturday parties. (It is not necessary to always be present if arrangements are made in advance for someone else to take the money)
 * Count and enter the amount collected in the appropriate fund in the ledger.
 * Deposit the funds - I usually do this at the end of each month.
 * Deposit checks for Demo Team performances.
 * Write rent checks to Waluga Lodge, St. Barnabas and the Saturday party venue.
 * Keep a record of teachers and write checks for them periodically.
 * Keep receipts for miscellaneous expenses and write checks for reimbursement.
 * Balance the checkbook against the bank statement monthly.
 * Create a monthly report of income/expenses - I have a spreadsheet for that.
 * Make various payments during the year, e.g. dues to Edinburgh, insurance, TAC memberships, publicity, Highland Games Association.
 * The busiest time of the year is, of course, around the Workshop & Ball when many checks have to be deposited and many expenses paid.
 * Attend Board meetings 3 or 4 times a year.

Talk to me if you might be interested, or email me at patmtay@comcast.net

== Arandel Formation ==
by Tom Halpenny

The arandel, pronounced “are-an-dell”, is a new formation that is best
described as “rights and lefts for three couples in eight bars.” First corners
cross over with partners, first corners set to each other, then cross over with
the dancer opposite and set. Other dancers dance rights and lefts: leading
woman in second place dances with top couple, and leading man in second place
dances with bottom couple.

We can devise new dances with arandel. We can also substitute arandel in many
three-couple dances that have rights and lefts. The additional activity by a
third couple increases the overall dancer activity.

The diagram below shows dancer positions after each two bars of arandel.
According to RSCDS Standard Terminology, circles are used to represent men and
squares to represent women. Each symbol contains a digit to show which man or
woman is represented by the symbol. The top of the set is at the bottom of the
diagram, as this shows the set from the normal position of a teacher at the
front of the class.

Arandel

This formation begins with all three couples on the sidelines facing their
partners across the dance.

Steps: 8 travelling steps, or 4 travelling steps and 4 setting steps

No of bars: 8

||Bars||||
||<style="vertical-align: top;">1-2||2nd, 1st and 3rd couples, giving right hands to partner, cross over to change sides.||
||<style="vertical-align: top;">3-4||2nd man and 3rd woman set to each other. 2nd and 1st women, giving left hands, change places on the sideline.<<BR>>1st and 3rd men giving left hands, change places on the sideline.||

All three couples are now back in their original places.<<BR>>On bar 8, 1st couple pull back by the left to dance into place (polite turn).||

== Progression in a Longwise Set ==
by Tom Halpenny

''The Manual of Scottish Country Dancing'' states, “An important feature of the
longwise country dance is that it is usually progressive. After each turn of
the dance, the couple at the top, who begin the dance, finish one place further
down, although in some dances there is a different order of progression. Each
of the other couples in succession, having reached the top, take their turn as
leading couple.” The Manual goes on to describe the most frequent forms of
progression for two-couple dances in four-couple sets, three-couple dances in
three-couple sets, three-couple dances in four-couple sets, four-couple dances
in four-couple sets, and five-couple dances in five-couple sets.

I thought it would be interesting to consider progression from a mathematical
permutation viewpoint and list all possible forms of progression.  The exercise
assumes partners remain together for each turn of a dance (although they may
finish on opposite sides), couples finish each dance turn in a different place,
and all couples effectively return to original places only after the final
turn.

We are most familiar with two-couple and three-couple dances in which the
leading couple progress down the set to "repeat, having passed a couple," while
one or more couples are idle at the bottom or top, for a total of eight turns.
The leading couple progress to the bottom or else step to the bottom after
their final turn.  We can number the couples and denote how couples change
places: 1 2 3 4 -> 2 1 3 4 -> 2 3 1 4.

The other type of progression has all couples dancing each turn, with the
number of turns equal to the number of couples.  We have a valid progression as
long as each couple move to a new place and all couples move to all places
during the turns of a dance.  An example of an invalid progression is 1 2 3 4
-> 2 1 4 3, because although each couple move to a new place, the couples only
begin in two different places during four turns.

The three-couple dance in a three-couple set can finish in six permutations,
equals 3 x 2 x 1, and two of the six permutations are a valid progression.  I
surveyed progression frequencies of dances in the ''[[https://www.rscds.org/document/762|RSCDS Index to Scottish Country Dances]]''.  We are most familiar with
1st couple finishing at the bottom (79%): 1 2 3 -> 2 3 1. The progression may
also run in reverse with 3rd couple finishing at the top (21%): 1 2 3 -> 3 1 2.

<img src="../images/gg_jan_2015_2.jpg" alt="Progressions of 3" width="273" height="57"/>
}}}

The four-couple dance in a four-couple set can finish in 24 permutations,
equals 4 x 3 x 2 x 1, and 6 of the 24 permutations are a valid progression. The
six progressions are three pairs which are the reverse of each other. The
frequencies of progression in the ''RSCDS Index'' are:

{{{#!html
<img src="../images/gg_jan_2015_3.jpg" alt="Progressions of 4" width="274" height="92"/>
}}}

The five-couple dance in a five-couple set can finish in 120 permutations,
equals 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1, and 24 of the 120 permutations are a valid
progression. The 24 progressions are 12 pairs which are the reverse of each
other. The frequencies of progression in the ''RSCDS Index'' are:

{{{#!html
<img src="../images/gg_jan_2015_4.jpg" alt="Progressions of 5" width="273" height="264"/>
}}}

In dances with the most frequent progression 1 2 3 4 5 -> 2 4 1 5 3, 1st and
3rd couples begin the dance and travel similar tracks with supporting couples
below them. Three-couple dances with progression 1 2 3 -> 2 3 1 and with 3rd
couple stationary at the right times can be adapted into such a five-couple
dance with this progression.

We can adapt the three-couple-dance 3 1 2 reverse progression into a
four-couple set with "repeat, having passed a couple." Since 3rd couple
progress to first place and 1st couple progress to second place, 1st couple
pass 3rd couple instead of passing 2nd couple: 1 2 3 4 -> 3 1 2 4 -> 3 4 1 2.
We can observe each turn of dancer positions in the table.

}}}

The tables show several progressions with low or zero percentage dance
frequencies. Dance devisors who are aware of the progression possibilities
might imagine new dances with an unusual progression.
