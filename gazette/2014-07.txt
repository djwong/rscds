== President’s Message ==
by Martin Mac​Kenzie

As we all know, while I was away on business, somehow I was elected to be
President/Chairperson of our illustrious little club!

In brief, this coming year, my idea is to foster fun, friendship, and gentle
conviviality in the context of our dancing and celebration of Scotland’s
culture. At the same time, I’ll count on our cadre of excellent teachers to
keep our feet moving and our brains a churnin’ and, as we have events such as
the various monthly dances and our workshop and ball, please come and step up
to the plate and perform various tasks to help keep all the gears smoothly
turning.

As has been announced, our participation in the Portland Highland Games is
somewhat different this year what with our transition from customary
demonstrations during the day as in previous years, to Ceilidh dancing towards
the evening. Please either sign up in class or come visit us at the Highland
Dance Competition stage starting at 4:00pm Saturday afternoon, July 19.

See all y’all on the dance floor!

==  Updated Officers 2014-15 ==
by Linda Gertz, Out-going President

I want to thank Martin for agreeing to be the new president.  I’m sure everyone
will give him the support and help he needs.

The 2014-15 officers are:

 * Chairman – Martin Mac​Kenzie
 * Vice Chairman – Sally Palmer
 * Secretary – Cathi Chlebnikow
 * Treasurer – Pat Taylor
 * Member at large – Holly Gibson
 * Teacher Coordinator – Linda Mae Dennis

Thought for the moment:  Giving of yourself is the best gift you can give.

== Teacher’s Corner ==
by Linda Mae Dennis

We’re about to wrap up dancing for the season, and kick back for a couple of
months. What?!

Even though we’re not dancing regularly, the reason that we do Scottish country
dancing still holds. Regular exercise for both your body and your brain,
coupled with social contact is really good for you. So it’s not so much a time
to do nothing as a time to do different things. And we are extremely lucky to
live in an area where the summer is wonderful – not too hot, and not too rainy
or humid. So you can invite a couple of your dancing friends or your family to
take a hike or bike ride and have a picnic. There might be time to try
swimming, rowing, canoeing, paddle boarding, sailing, or kite surfing. You
could plan to walk to the store or to a movie – it stays light so late that
there’s even time after work. Or you could work on the yard – landscaping, or
working through some of those around-the-house projects that have been put off
for too long (among other things, window washing is on my list). There’s golf,
tennis, volleyball, soccer, horseshoes – so many ways to stay active through
the summer.

To stay mentally active, there are crossword puzzles, jigsaw puzzles, logic
puzzles, and new projects or hobbies that test your mental acuity, like sewing,
knotwork, or building a dodecahedron (bucky ball) with toothpicks.

Of course, there are still some dancing opportunities. The Southwest Washington
State Branch picnic is coming up on July 13th, there’s a ceilidh at the
Portland Highland Games on July 19th, there might be a Fifth Tuesday Social
Dance on July 29th (stay tuned – details to follow) and the Portland Branch
picnic is Saturday, August 23rd.  Our Portland Branch classes break for the
summer after Monday, July 14 and start up again on Monday, September 8.

Starting over in September is always exciting. You’ll get to see friends that
you haven’t seen for a while, greet others that you have played with over the
summer, and hopefully meet some new people who are trying out Scottish country
dancing for the first time – possibly people you have met doing your summer
activities and brought along.

There’s nothing worse than coming back from a summer break only to realize that
you can barely dance because you’ve been sitting on the patio eating hot dogs
for two months, your muscles are weak, and your lung capacity is down to
nothing. So, stay well, stay active, and have a great summer.

== Suttle Lake Dance Camp ==
by Tom Halpenny

Liza and Tom Halpenny attended their first English and Scottish Dance Camp
Weekend June 6-8, 2014 at the Suttle Lake camp near Sisters Oregon, hosted for
the 25th year by the Heather and the Rose Country Dancers.  Liza taught the
Scottish country dance workshop, while Sharon Green from Berkeley California
taught the English country dance workshop.  Musicians for the weekend were
Betsy Branch (fiddle), Leslie Hirsch (fiddle), Lisa Scott (piano), and Seth
Goldman (bassoon).

We arrived 4:30pm after a leisurely drive, with a side visit to Silver Falls
State Park for a 1-hour hike that took us underneath the falls.  We settled
into our room among the beautiful surroundings of tall trees and met our fellow
dancers numbering about 45. We recognized several friends from other Scottish
dance events and new friends we met on our January visit to the Roseburg
Midwinter Party.

The weekend was a great way to get to know everyone within the lodge where we
danced and ate.  Tables were set up for meals and taken down for dancing.
Delicious, healthful meals were prepared by revered chef, Annie.  The Friday
evening dance welcomed everyone with a sample of dancing to the fantastic
music. I finished the day with 25,000 pedometer steps.  Saturday was a full day
of dance workshops, and we briefly rested up for the high-energy evening ball.
The intermission featured Alixe Dancer’s famous berry cobbler and ice cream.  I
finished the day with 29,000 pedometer steps. (A typical SCD day is 15,000
steps.) Sunday morning featured a review of the favorite dances of the weekend.
We said our goodbyes to friends and fit in a side trip to nearby lava
formations, and drove home, finishing the day with 19,000 pedometer steps and
pleasant memories with dance friends in the beautiful setting.

We can visit the Heather and Rose website to learn about their program
http://heatherandrose.org/ .  H&R is a statewide network of dance groups in
Oregon which teach both English and Scottish Country Dance and use global
terminology for teaching.  The Eugene group hosts a Harvest Ball, the Roseburg
group hosts a Midwinter Party, and the Ashland group hosts the Spring Ball.
The groups dance two-thirds English and one-third Scottish dances.

Global terminology refers to a dancer’s position within the dance rather than
gender. The “men’s side” is called “left file” and the “ladies’ side” is called
“right file”. Dancers form sets by lining up individually on either file, and
whoever appears on the opposite file is their partner.  We can also line up
with a partner, with a little jockeying for position, as single dancers form in
front.  I found the practice refreshing and efficient. It didn’t matter whether
I knew anyone. My dance partner appeared and could be either gender.  I enjoyed
the variety of forming sets on the right file and dancing familiar Scottish
dances from the unfamiliar side. I can imagine how the practice can help one
improve their dancing skills.

A quality I liked about Heather and Rose is their interest to dance both
English and Scottish dance, which I have discovered can be a rare quality among
folk dancers to dance more than a single dance form. I was able to add Donna to
my list of Dauntless Dancers, friends who have danced three folk dance forms
with me one time. I had met Donna at a Contra dance last December.

== If You Can Follow the Code, You Can Dance! ==
by Tom Halpenny

I was fortunate to be part of the dance team who helped Darrick Wong present
Scottish country dance at the Open Source Bridge conference June 26, 2014. We
can read the abstract of the presentation
http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1245.  Aided by ten dancers, including
three teachers and a fiddler, Darrick demonstrated four Scottish dances and
described how the figures of a dance flow sequentially like a computer program,
and how the testing of a new dance is similar to testing a new computer program
for correct operation.  My fellow dancers smoothly traveled the figures to the
fiddle tunes of Maggie Hannahs.

I was curious who would attend Darrick’s innovative presentation? All six
audience members enthusiastically accepted the invitation for the final “Loon
Mountain Reel” dance with six-couples.  I had previously met Sonia at an
International folk dance, and she also writes computer programs.  The room’s
fifty seats filled for the next conference session.  So I was able to deduce
the general aversion that engineers have for dancing.

This reminds me of my experience with fellow Hewlett Packard engineers.  Liza
taught a weekly lunchtime SCD class at HP, with John Shaw and myself as support
members. A surprising result was that the majority of these supposedly creative
engineers lacked the curiosity to walk 100 feet to a conference room to try
something new.  The negative response is an example where people are
psychologically blocked from exploring, so therefore there is probably a rich
set of discoveries to be made.  We can read the newsletter item “Scottish
Country Dance Comes to Hewlett Packard”
http://www.rscds-swws.org/news/200603/vol22-5.htm

Thanks to Darrick Wong, Don Gertz, Linda Gertz, Maureen Sloan, Linda Mae
Dennis, Patrick Hogan, Liza Halpenny, Tom Halpenny, Janice Taylor, Maggie
Faber, and Maggie Hannahs, for teaming up for such an unusual venue Scottish
dancing.

== Alasdair Fraser’s Sierra Fiddle Camp, June 14-22, 2014  ==
by Stephen Hui

Our family’s annual visit to the Alasdair Fraser Sierra Fiddle Camp is a trip I
look forward to because of the great music experience, the chance to observe
and learn from great musicians.  There are also opportunities to play music
with fellow campers.

The drive coming down I-5 was smooth and we stopped by our favorite fast food
place, In-N-Out Burger.  Even though the sky was overcast, I was confident that
we would have a dry week at the Shady Creek Outdoor School camp site, snuggled
deep in the Sierra Nevada Foothills, near central California between Sacramento
and Reno.

Registration and welcome introduction to the camp was festive.  Campers were
catching up with each other after a year-long separation.  I couldn’t help but
notice that some of the kids grew a few inches since I last saw them.  The
first evening ended with the traditional impromptu dance party where all the
kids just could not contain their excitement of seeing each other and the music
seemed to be going on and on forever.

We found our class locations, and soon began to hear new fiddle tunes echoing
throughout the camp site.  There was dancing every night and I could see it
taking a toll on some of the older campers, but it didn’t seem to affect young
campers that much, although I did notice some sleeping bags with bodies in them
during the free time.

The camp featured music from a group of Swedish musicians, another team with
American tradition (country folk), and the one and only Scottish fiddler
Alasdair himself.  The concert given by the instructors was a great treat –
many of the instructors are well known recording artists.  The Swedes brought
their rich traditional music fused with their creative twists of rhythm and
interpretation.  It was delightful to see young musicians blossoming in front
of our eyes in just one year of time.  Many of the camp staff teachers were one
time campers themselves and now performing all over the world, besides coming
back to their roots to help raise up the next generation of musicians. 

Ceilidh night was hilarious as usual with some of the acts depicting various
camper characters, especially the ones about the camp staff or instructors –
they always seem to be spot-on the special body language, the way they talk, or
special phrases used by the characters.  The talents and creativity of the
campers were just awesome.

Final concert was the most anticipated event where the whole week’s learning
experience climaxed.  Rehearsal started with the rhythm section of guitar,
cellos, and pianos.   Alasdair is a master at drawing out the essence of each
tune, and skillfully weaves into each piece the mesmerizing groove he wants.
In fact he asked the rehearsal to be video recorded in case it would happen to
be the perfect sound he was hoping to create.  There were great fiddling,
singing, and dancing performances led by Alasdair and Natalie Haas, Brittany
Haas, Jayme Stone, Moire Smiley, Laura Cortese, and a special guest bagpiper,
the local orchestra and choral music director Ryan Murray.  The audience was
thrilled by the electrifying performance from the Swedes.

A wound-down lasagna dinner followed after the concert.  Many campers reflected
on the week’s experience, expressed thank-you’s, and gave credits to fellow
campers and staff, especially the ones who worked tirelessly in the background.
I was exhausted but felt good about the experience.  As we drove down the
mountain, many of the faces, and tunes were circling through my mind and
accompanied us on our way home.
