== From The President ==
by Holly Gibson

'''W'''ell, it’s happened again, Christmas is over and January has arrived in all its blustery glory. Before we know it, it will be time for the workshop and ball and then the summer break. And of course this is also the season for resolutions (although, that season seems to be getting shorter and shorter). A number of years ago I had a gym membership and we regulars hated January because all the machines would be taken by the Near Year’s resolutioners - for about three weeks or so - until they got tired of having one more thing to do before going home after a long day at work or just weren’t seeing the results they had hoped for after a few weeks. You could always spot them because their gym clothes were brand new and did not consist of old shorts and a ratty t-shirt. That seems to be how people are, we make a change and expect results instantly instead of a realistic slow and steady progress. This inevitably leads to failure and then self-recriminations and a return to old patterns. For some of us, it’s getting into a rut (this from the person who ate practically the same thing for lunch every day in elementary school), or maybe it’s never sticking with anything long enough to even make a tread pattern, much less a rut. Both ways are out of balance and a good reason for us to analyze why it is we do things the way we do.

This also applies to us in our reel lives as dancers. Clubs and individuals can fall into habits and before you know it, you’re saying “that’s the way we’ve always done it.” when a new person comes to a class and wants to know the reason behind something. Of course, routines often make sense, such as warm-ups before class, step practice, and having two levels of classes to benefit both the newer dancer and the seasoned one. Because of its nature, it can be difficult to find and keep a balance in Scottish Country Dancing, which has to maintain certain structures and features in order to retain its history and character. It’s difficult to maintain a strong and rich tradition without stifling the growth, and sometimes change, that will allow it to continue on. And so, since we’re Scottish Country Dancers and love challenges, let’s think about new ways to attract more dancers, new activities for us to enjoy together, or maybe even something different to have for lunch.

== Hong Kong RSCDS Class, 2017 ==
by Stephen Hui

'''O'''ne of the exciting things that I looked forward to besides my high-school reunion was to attend an RSCDS class in Hong Kong. After several email exchanges with the Hong Kong RSCDS coordinator, I went to my RSCDS class in Hong Kong for the first time. It was at a dance studio more than an hour away by train and subway. The instructor Stephen Li, is the first Chinese teacher to be fully certified by RSCDS. In the email I received, they said the class would be taught in Cantonese, but I found out that he used mostly English to teach the dances. Only once and a while he and other more advanced dancers would shout out some Cantonese to help the dancers move to their correct spots. There were about ten dancer couples, and like our US classes in Portland and Vancouver, most of them were ladies. There were only three men (an English man, Stephen the instructor and Stephen the visitor). Some of the ladies brought their husbands or boy friends but they just sat in the lobby/welcome room with their phones – I even asked one of them to join the class, but no takers. Something about the Chinese culture, dancing is mostly for women. I guess they might think that I have been corrupted by Western culture. We did four dances and I only knew one of them, Australian Ladies. I didn’t know or remember the other three: Eileen Watt’s Reel, Gothenburg’s Welcome, and Glastonbury Tor. I have all the Crib diagrams if anyone is interested. One of the interesting patterns I have not seen or done before was tandem reel of four (in Eileen Watt’s Reel). Stephen Li gave the briefing along with walk through - each couple got a chance to be first couple. The dancers seemed to learn pretty fast if this was the first time the dances were taught. I made a mental note that there was not any strathspeys taught at the class. But after the class, there was cookie time – the instructor brought cookies to share with everyone.

After the class, the instructor asked one of the dancers to invite me to another venue which they called the Highlanders Dance held at the Hong Kong Cricket Club. It took us almost an hour to get there, riding in the English man’s Honda N-box. The instructor was another English man. I recognized the Flowers of Edinburgh. In chatting with the instructor and some of the long time dancers, I found out the reason why strathspeys were not taught was because they thought it was too hard, not too hard in the technical learning of the dance and steps, but hard to get people interested in doing the dance. They gear their teaching toward what is popular for their balls which usually draw several hundred dancers. They don’t have enough time to prepare them adequately if they include strathspeys or some of the more serious/elegant dances. They would usually have simple dances for the balls, even ceilidh-like dances such as Strip the Willow, an interesting perspective. One of the more experienced dancers did say that they are working to bring strathspeys to their dance repertoire this coming year.

I was very pleased to see that no matter where you are, RSCDS people are always warm and welcoming. I first experienced that in Portland and Vancouver, now in Hong Kong.

== The Stories of Tunes ==
by Holly Gibson

'''A'''nyone who has ever perused a list of tune names was likely struck at the amazing variety (and humor) in their names. Oh sure, there’s the usual “So and So’s Reel” but when you see a tune name like The Merry Blacksmith or Jock Broke the Prison Door, you know there has to be a story behind it, and if there’s not, there should be. Tune names are underlined.

__Miss Jessie Stewart__ was seen at __the shoemaker__ buying __the ruby slippers__, which were pretty enough to make someone want to __smash the windows__ to get to them because red slippers are __all the rage__ right now.  Alas, the red slippers were no help. Jessie turned __40 shades of green__ with envy after __going to the barn dance__ and seeing __Bill May of Boddam__, who was quite __the elegant gentleman__, dancing with __the girl with the blue dress__, who is also __the maid that tends the goats__ as well as __the lambs on the green hills__.

__Malcolm Beattie (of Galashiels) - the piano tuner__ - was __lugging the box__ full of tools along __the Crow Road__ wondering how anyone could say __thank goodness it’s Monday__ when Monday always meant work. Work was __never on Sunday__ but instead everyone enjoyed __jogging in Hyde__ __Park__ before eating __Peking Duck__ and, __after supper__, __strawberries galore__.  Of course, some would rather __sleep soond i'da moarnin'__instead of jogging in Hyde Park, or anywhere else.

__Billy the barber__ was known about town as quite forgetful, and anyone who was having their hair cut while asking him about the time he climbed up __the Witches Hill__ showed an amazing __absence of forethought__.  They had no right to be angry if their sideburns resembled __a swallow’s tail__ by the time Billy got through, because whenever he started talking he couldn’t remember if he was trimming hair or __the rose tree__ growing behind his __old farmhouse.__  If he ever said to a customer, “Why is it that __you’re sitting in my chair__?” they knew they’d be wearing a hat for a few weeks to come.  After all, he wasn’t called __the absent minded man__ for nothing.

__Sherriff A.C. McPherson of the Glasgow Highland Club__ is __hanging up the hat and handcuffs__ soon. He’s finally had enough of __chatterin’ teeth__ and wearing __the dripping hat__ caused by the __cold and raw__ __black summer rain__ and __foggy dew__.  __The last straw__ was __the night that Miss Cooney eloped__ with __the curly headed plough boy__.  Poor McPherson couldn’t take any more cries of “__Oh dear, what can the matter be__?” from Miss Cooney’s mother and walked out of __Broomfield Cottage__ heading for __the auld inn__ saying “__Everything stops for tea__.”

The __Duchess of Hamilton__ spent many hours, until she was quite __pressed for time,__ trying on hats searching for the one she liked best. Finally she told the shopkeeper, “__I’ll take this one and that one over there__.  The shopkeeper was assured there was no want __for lack of gold__ and happily bundled the hats together with __the knotted piece of string__. Later when the Duke saw what the Duchess had bought, he unwittingly said, “__Where did you get that hat__?” He will most likely be going to the neighbors asking “__Can I sleep in your barn__ until __harvest time__?”

== Scottish Fisherman Superstitions ==
Compiled by Melissa Whitson from information collected by Martin Evans and by Margaret Umphrey

Every country has its share of superstitions.  In the 19th and early 20th century in Scotland, there were many superstitions associated with sea fishing (as opposed to river fishing).  In those times, the fisherman typically spent weeks out at sea so a safe return was not at all assured.  Superstitions naturally developed over time and varied by locality.  Here are some interesting examples. *       Some fishermen would not sail if they passed a nun, crow, cat, dog, rabbit, or a redheaded person on the way to their vessel. *       Some fishermen would not sail if they saw a rat some ashore off their vessel (perhaps the rat knew something they didn’t?) or if pigeons or doves were found on board. *       When leaving the harbor, always turn the boat clockwise. *       Never stir tea with a knife or fork. *       The teapot must not be emptied after the fishing had started. To empty it might make the ship turn over and sink, or result in a poor trip. *       Never lay a broom on top of the nets. *       Egg shells should be broken into tiny pieces (to stop witches sailing in them). *       The salt-pot must not be handed from one crewman to another – “pass salt, pass sorrow”. *       Upturning a hatch cover or sleeping on the stomach were actions said to anticipate the boat turning over and sinking. *       Losing a hat overboard signified a long trip. *       For good luck, eat fish from the head to the tail.  Starting at the tail will warn the shoals away from the shore and back into deep water. *       Set an odd number of nets, such as 101; the extra one is “for luck.” *       Don’t count the number of fish caught as it will result in no more fish being caught that day.  Count the fish when safely back in port. *       Don’t use certain words at sea.  Don’t mention pigs, fox, cat, rabbit, salmon, rat, or the church or churchmen.  Substitute words such as curly tail for pig, long tail for rat, and black coat for minister.  If the bad word is

 . accidentally spoken, the antidote is to quickly touch cauld iron.

*       Don’t wash the herring scales from boots or deck.  It will wash away good luck. *       Don’t go to sea at the start of the fishing season until a few drops of blood have been shed by a crew member in a fight or accident.

== Iain Dubh, The Wizard of the North ==
by

Donald MacDonald

'''I'''ain Dubh Dhomhnaill nan Òran, Black John, son of Donald of the Songs, was born in Glendale, Isle of Skye in 1844, a most unusual child of most unusual parents. Black of hair and swarthy of skin in a community of fair-haired Celts, it was natural that he would acquire the nickname, Iain Dubh - Black John.

Iain Dubh's father, Domhnall nan Òran was a bard of quite some talent, and Iain's older brother, Neil, went on to become one of nineteenth century Gaeldom's best-known bards, publishing Clarsach an Doire, a collection of his songs that went into several printings.

But several years later, the nickname took on a new and ominous significance when Iain Dubh was accused of being skilled in the Black Arts, and in cahoots with the Devil himself. That is when he became known as the Wizard of the North.

There are dozens of compelling accounts of the wizardry of Iain Dubh, and whether he was a superb hypnotist or conjurer, or both, or whether his talent really came from supernatural sources, is still debated. Many of these reports came from deeply religious people and from the ministers of the church, who were constantly after him to change his ways.

'''Chicken Thief'''

One such encounter with a minister took place on a summer day outside Iain Dubh's mother's house where Iain, home on leave between voyages, was idly watching a mother hen teaching her newly hatched brood how to scratch for a living. Ready for battle, the minister came through the gate and lost no time in challenging Iain about his evil ways, soundly berating him for his liason with Satan.

Iain listened till the minister stopped for a moment to catch his breath, and quietly did some accusing of his own. "You have never seen me doing any of those things of which you accuse me," he told the minister, "and you, of all people have no right to challenge me. You are nothing but a chicken thief! You stand there and preach to me with your pockets full of my poor mother's chickens."

The minister stood there, sputtering to find new words while Iain pointed to the pockets of the reverend man's long black frock coat. Sure enough, each pocket contained three or four of the broody hen's flock, and there could be no denying what both men could see. The minister left then, but he would be back to continue his crusade against Satan's henchman.

'''Dancing Pototoes'''

The incident closest to being actually documented describes Iain on another journey home, visiting a neighbor's house. As usual, his presence there attracted several of his contemporaries from the village, and they sat yarning as "bean an taighe" the woman of the house, was boiling potatoes in a large pot hung above the open fire.

Suddenly, one by one, the potatoes began to leap from the pot into the fire and on to the floor. Iain had not gone near them at any time, but when the poor woman, aware of his reputation, declared him to be the culprit, all the potatoes jumped back into the pot.

Aboard ship, Iain was not popular with tyrannical officers, and were it not for his superb seamanship he would have been declared persona non grata on every ship afloat.

They had good reason to avoid Iain Dubh's wizardry as one of his favorite stunts was to make his antagonists sprout horns which all but the victim could see - definitely a no-no in the rigid realms of good order and discipline.

== UK/Europe Scottish Dancers Visit Pacific Northwest ==
by Tom Halpenny

'''W'''e first met George Flett at the March 2003 Scottish Country Dance week in Hawaii. We can read the newsletter item titled Scottish Country Dancing, Hawaiian-Style. <<BR>> http://www.rscds-swws.org/news/200305/vol19-6.htm

I was delighted to receive an email from George in October explaining, "For something like 15 years I have been saying I’d like to attend the Asilomar weekend. I’m going to do so this year and had the idea of also having a holiday in the area North of San Francisco which I have never visited. My idea is simply to meander from San Francisco north just exploring the area. I managed to persuade two of my SCD friends to join me in this venture, Chris Harris from Switzerland and Muriel Wilson who dances in the same local club as me in Maidenhead. I also made the suggestion that we might find local SCD groups on our journey where we might do dancing some evening."

They planned to attend a dance evening hosted by the Seattle Branch, so I informed George about Scottish dance activities in the Vancouver-Portland area, and invited the group to stay in the Halpenny home. They happily accepted the invitation and visited two Vancouver dance classes and one Portland dance class.

George is one of the founding leaders of the RSCDS International Branch in 2004. Chris supports the branch website and has been the quarterly newsletter editor in recent years. The branch purpose within RSCDS has been to provide a home and dance events for members who are too far from local branches and who have no representation at the RSCDS Annual General Meeting. The branch enjoys a growing membership with 434 total members, composed of 165 primary members and 269 secondary members who are primary members from other RSCDS branches. The branch holds its AGM online for one week during the first week in December. We can visit the branch website at http://www.rscds-ib.org/ and Facebook group at https://www.facebook.com/groups/18658220904 to learn more.

A key practice in order to reinforce identity amongst branch members is to take a photo of International Branch members who attend Scottish dance events worldwide. We recorded a photo of dancers at Marge's November 14 Dancing Through the Ages class and the International Branch members who attended.

Thank you George, Chris, and Muriel for your delightful company, and we look forward to visiting with you again in the future!

== Vancouver, B.C., Scottish Ceilidh Dance ==
by Martin MacKenzie

This past Thanksgiving 2017 weekend, after enjoying a visit with family in the Poulsbo, Washington area, we jumped across the border into Vancouver, B.C. to take in a Scottish Ceilidh dance and class at the Scottish Cultural Centre. We were curious as well as looking for a means of mitigating the effects of too much Thanksgiving eating.

The ceilidh dances and classes are held at the Scottish Cultural Centre in Vancouver, B.C. on Hudson Street. Upon looking around at the walls of the venue I discovered, indicated by plaques on two of the walls was that one of the huge advantages that this area has were the immigration of many Scottish people to this area, especially in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. These pioneers all established various clubs and organizations to support their history and culture. Examples of this are The Sons of Scotland, Comunn Gàidhlig Bhancoubhair The Gaelic Society of Vancouver, The St. Andrews and Caledonian Society of Vancouver, B.C. and, of course, The Vancouver Branch of The Royal Scottish Country Dance Society.

We learned of this group at TAC Summer School, 2017 from a Duncan MacKenzie, no relation to our little twig of the MacKenzies. To learn more about the group, visit: <<BR>>http://www.vancouverceilidh.org/

We learned that before a ceilidh dance, a class is held to get beginners up to scratch. The class is quite basic so that anyone can join in and most of the dances that will be danced are taught in the class. This reminded me a bit of the kinds of beginner's classes that are often held before a contra dance. Both Duncan MacKenzie and Alison Moen, without fuss or stress, ably guided the new dancers and old hands through their paces and prepared everyone for the dance soon to follow. Everyone was very kind and friendly and the two aforementioned leaders but especially Duncan made sure that everyone that wanted to dance had a partner before beginning each dance. All dances are walked through at least once and the dancing is a simple walking step with no special attire required. As an aside, we also learned that this is a kind of feeder system for the Vancouver RSCDS branch for individuals interested in learning more and challenging themselves beyond this more basic style of dance.

== Fiddle And Piano, Scottish Dance ==
by Tom Halpenny

'''I''' became aware that there exist two distinct cultures of Scottish dance music in the world: accordion band and fiddle & piano instrumentation. I attended my first Scottish dance in the UK at the January 2015 Trinity Ball and enjoyed listening to the accordion band with "box", keyboard, and drum musicians. This compares with my experience at home with all fiddle & piano Scottish dance music that has a significantly different sound. We observe that the RSCDS numbered books music is recorded exclusively with accordion band. I suggested to RSCDS that they also record RSCDS numbered books music with fiddle & piano instruments in order to capture additional sales, but there has been low interest so far.

I observed some possible evidence of the two music cultures while examining lists of frequently danced dances,  maintained by Campbell Tyler from Cape Town, South Africa: <<BR>> https://rscdscapetown.wordpress.com/frequently-danced-dances/.  The website displays a master list of 500 most frequent dances in all the programmes recorded, plus regional programme lists from USA, Canada, Scotland, Great Britain excluding Scotland, Europe excluding Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.

The high-energy dance titled Da Rain Dancin' features fiddle & piano music by Muriel Johnstone and Keith Smith. We can listen to an excerpt at: <<BR>>http://www.rscds-swws.org/news/stories/DaRainDancin.mp3 The dance ranks 209 in the list of 500 most frequent dances. The dance ranks 80 in the USA list of 147 dances, and ranks 34 in the Europe excluding Great Britain list of 94 dances. However Da Rain Dancin' fails to appear in any of the other regional lists where accordion band music is dominant.
