== President’s Message ==
by Linda Gertz

Spring is in the air, and as with most of you, I’m enjoying being able to
get out and about.  We have one more monthly party on Saturday, May 10,
2014.  Marcy has come up with an idea for handling the monthly parties.
That is to have people sign up for one month.  Please see my article below
for further information.  

This will be my last President’s Message to you, as in June we will meet to
have the change of officers.  On Monday, May 12th we will have our Annual
General Meeting.  If anyone has anything they would like to have brought up
at the meeting, please let me know.  The schedule for Monday’s class will
be:  an hour of dancing, a quick meeting, then more dancing.  All dances
will be appropriate for all dancers.  So hope to see you there.  On to more
dancing adventures together!

== Teacher’s Corner ==
by Don Gertz

I was having trouble deciding on a topic for this month’s Teacher’s Corner,
so Linda suggested that I go back through back issues of the Ghillie
Gazette. I decided to reuse and article by Jane Lataille that was in the
March/April 1997 issue and originally published in TACTalk.

== Stamp Out Dance Injuries ==
by Jane Lataille, Windsor CT

You can dance more and ache less if you follow these suggestions:

=== Keep in Shape ===

The most common injury frequent dancer sustain is damage to the cartilage in
the knee and hip joints. Ankles are also vulnerable. These joints take a
pounding in Scottish dancing! Damage is less likely if the muscles around
these joints are strong. Here are exercises you can do to strengthen them:

 * Knees - Step up and down onto a platform 2-3 inches high until you feel the muscles start to tire. Alternate feet.
 * Hips - Sideways leg lifts.
 * Ankles - Sit on one chair and face another. With heels on the floor, push out with the feet against the inside of the legs of the second chair.

Besides exercises for these joints, you can improve your dance fitness with
these measures:

 * Muscle tone - Stretch muscles, especially calf and thigh muscles, before and after exercise, dancing, or any other activity.
 * Cardio-vascular fitness - Jog, do aerobics, swim, or bike to keep heart and lungs active. Don’t smoke!
 * General health - Get plenty of sleep, eat a balanced diet, and keep your weight near your ideal weight.

=== Don’t Skip Warm-Ups ===

Before every dance, do warm-ups. Start with brisk walking to get good blood
circulation before trying to stretch.

Do slow and gentle stretches, and be sure to include arches, calves, and
thighs. Tense and relax muscles, then stretch again. Work the tension out of
your shoulders.

End warm-ups with some skip-change and pas-de-basque to get your feet and
legs into the swing of it before dancing.

=== Dance Correctly ===

Good dancing habits go a long way toward preventing injuries. Make the
following suggestions an automatic part of your dancing:

 * Dance with relaxed muscles.
 * Dance with good posture.
 * Keep your centre of mass over your feet, especially when turning or circling.
 * Use good handing.
 * Don’t assume you’ll get good handing from others every time; be prepared to “dance on your own feet.”
 * Always dance with “soft” arches and knees. Use your arches and leg muscles to land gently and absorb impact, especially for pas-de-basque.
 * Turn out from the hip, not the knee.
 * Be watchful. Develop “eyes in the back of your head.”
 * Don’t dance if you know you are tired. Don’s note - It’s OK to dance walk.
 * Never skip “step practice.” This is your chance to develop and maintain technique that will keep you dancing.

Happy Dancing!

== Saturday Dance Party Tea Information ==
by Linda Gertz

Some of you might be wondering what you would be getting into when you agree
to do the tea, etc., for a Saturday Dance Party.  

Here is what needs to be done:

Before the night of the party:

Check the cabinet to make sure there are enough supplies of:
tea/sugar/plates/cups/forks and napkins.

Note:  For drinks we currently have regular tea, decaf tea, herbal teas &
instant coffee bags

On the night of the event:

 1. Bring milk for the tea.

 2. Move the little table that’s up front to the back to put the tea stuff on.

 3. Fill the urn that says “Hot Water” with water.  You don’t need the tray in it that would normally hold the tea or coffee.  Get out cords for the pot - don’t plug in until intermission.

 4. Put out teas/coffee/stir sticks/sugar/cups on the little table.

 5. Put a tablecloth on the big table to be used for putting treats on.  

 6. Set out napkins, plates and forks.

 7. Afterwards empty out the tea urn, put stuff back in the cabinet.  If needed take tablecloth & milk pitcher home to wash & return.
 
EXTRA THINGS YOU COULD DO:

 1. Bring a centerpiece for the table.

 2. Do tablecloths for all the tables used.

 3. Any other idea you might have (surprise us!)

Please feel free to email Marcy to sign up for one of the following Saturday
Dance Parties:

October 11, 2014; November 14, 2014; December 12, 2014; January 10, 2015;
February 14, 2015; April 11, 2015; May 9, 2015

== Recipes ==

Linda Gertz’s Easy Pineapple Pie:
 

 * 1 16 oz sour cream
 * 1 16 oz can crushed pineapple (don’t drain)
 * 1 small pkg (4 serv size) Instant vanilla pudding

Mix all together - put in a graham cracker crust & refrigerate.

Note:  They aren’t making 16 oz cans of pineapple now, so I used two 8 oz
cans.  It seems they might be putting more liquid in the cans than they used
to (so probably less pineapple).  So you might want to hold back on a little
of the pineapple juice in the can.  The last one I made was a bit runny
using all of the juice.

== Thank You! Thank You! Thank You! Thank You! ==
by Eunice Mac​Kenzie

As you know, almost two months ago, I had a very painful, debilitating
shoulder affliction. You of the Portland Scottish Country Dancers were so
compassionate and generous in your words and deeds. I know that I verbally
thanked most of you, but I just wanted my “thanks” in writing. 

Thank you all very much!

Gratefully, Eunice Mac​Kenzie 

== Scottish Dance Technique ==
by Tom Halpenny

I wrote a newsletter item 18 months ago, “The Importance of Eye Contact in
Manual of Scottish Country Dancing”.
http://www.rscds-swws.org/news/201211/vol29-3.htm#EyeContact  I was
wondering where the “eye contact” social dancing skill came from, since it
was not specifically mentioned in The Manual? I communicated with RSCDS and
they thought the upcoming third edition could contain a sentence or
paragraph about the subject. 

I recently had an opportunity to read the third edition and I was curious to
read what RSCDS has to say about eye contact. Before I give you the results,
I would like to report what I learned about the Dance Technique topic.  I
have been attending Marge’s Dance Technique class since September, so I
wanted to get straight in my brain the methods of Dance Technique that we
need to think about while we are traveling the formations (figures) of a
dance.  

We can read the Dance Appearance and Etiquette methods in sections 3.2 and
3.3 of The Manual. I grouped the methods into logical categories:

 * Dance etiquette, management of a set

 * Anticipation, phrasing, covering

 * Steps, footwork

 * Handing

 * Deportment

 * Bow and curtsey

 * Spirit of the dance

The following equations define combinations of the methods:

Teamwork = anticipation + management of a set + covering

Technique = steps + footwork + handing + phrasing + covering

Following are definitions of the methods, with the help of The Manual.

'''Dance etiquette:''' Dancers wait until a dance is announced before forming
sets. Join others at the end of the lines.  Be aware of set boundaries.
After the dance, thank other dancers and clear the floor.

'''Management of a set:''' Maintain appropriate set width and length and position
to suit the movements of the dance.

'''Anticipation:''' Dancer observes all that is happening in the set and
anticipates what is about to happen, maintaining continuous flow.

'''Phrasing:''' Dancer begins each formation on the first beat of the musical
phrase and completes the formation on the end of the final beat of the
phrase.

'''Covering:''' Dancer has an awareness of their own position in relation to the
position of other dancers.

'''Steps, footwork:''' The method is described in chapter 5 of The Manual.

'''Handing:''' The method is described in the Introduction to chapter 6 of The
Manual.

'''Deportment:''' Dancer has an upright carriage for good balance, easy and
natural poise, and no excessive body movement.

'''Bow and curtsy:''' Dancer begins and ends a dance by honoring partner,
performed rhythmically during a chord.  Three parts: gather self up, move
down, and back up, while looking at partner.

'''Spirit of the dance:''' The expression of the true spirit comes from the
stimulus of the music and each individual’s response to the lively, elegant
movements of the dance. 

Now for the results of the RSCDS advice about eye contact. I observed that
the subject continues to be omitted in the third edition.  I thought about
how eye contact fits with the methods, and I concluded that eye contact with
our fellow dancers contributes to the spirit of the dance, as described in
the following quote from The Manual.

“Mastering of the skills which have been described may lead to the correct
performance of the dance without, however, expressing the true spirit of the
Scottish country dance - “performing” rather than “dancing”. The expression
of the true spirit cannot be taught. It comes from the stimulus of the music
and each individual’s response to the lively, elegant movements of the
dance. During an adjudication at a Scottish Country Dance Festival, Dr
Milligan exclaimed: “It is a pity that there are so many performers and so
few dancers.” The difference between “performing” and “dancing” has to be
appreciated in order to bring out several important characteristics of
Scottish country dancing.”

== Youth Weekend West 2014 ==
by Darrick Wong

I recently had the pleasure of participating in the twelfth annual Youth
Weekend West workshop, ceilidh, and ball at Western Washington University in
Bellingham.  This event was, of course, the latest iteration of the event that
coincided with the Southwest Washington branch's Dinner Dance last May.  It was
organized by Rachel Leacock, a student at WWU.  In addition to Western
students, there were again many dancers who travelled from Seattle, Victoria,
Vancouver B.C., Oregon, and California.

Friday night after dinner, we gathered in a sprawling gym on the Western campus
for the opening ceilidh.  It was a good thing that they reserved such a large
space — apparently word had spread around campus and many college age kids had
shown up to dance!  Rosemary Read, the local Scottish Country Dance teacher at
the university, directed the dancers through a number of large circle dances.
Though many of the people at the ceilidh dance weren’t Scottish dancers, they
got a small taste of what it is like.  Jack Dorian of Richland danced a
sailor’s hornpipe for one of the ceilidh acts.

On Saturday, we broke into three groups sorted by skill level, and headed off
to classes.  Katherine Shearman, Jim Maiolo, and Irene Paterson each taught one
session for each of the groups.  For those of us in the advanced class,
Katherine taught a workshop on the various kinds of setting steps and
flourishes that go with them; Irene taught a number of unusual strathspeys; and
Jim helped us to work on smoothing out transitions between different kinds and
directions of steps.  According to Jennifer Seelye of the Bend, the
intermediate class was taught a Star Trek themed dance, among other dances.
The author regrets not spectating ''this'' dance.  After lunch, there were two
elective classes — one with called salsa dances, and the other was Israeli folk
dancing.  It is quite a hoot to see three men dance the “camel” in a line.

In the evening, we reconvened in a ballroom that had a beautiful overlook of
Bellingham Bay.  Callum Mac​Kinnon and his band played some wonderful
tunes for the dance program, and Sonata Yau of Victoria piped us in the grand
march.  There was a lively mix of the usual Scottish dances such as ''The
Flowers of Edinburgh'' and ''The Reel of the Royal Scots'', and a rare treat —
just before the intermission, all the men formed one large set to dance the
''Reel of the 51st Division'' together.  This was quite the dance to have
witnessed, for the men were delighted to show off their various setting steps,
high kicks, and other gleeful antics!

Sunday morning, the tired dancers gathered one last time for some more relaxed
dances before it was time for us to bid each other adieu until next year.  If
you are interested in dancing with energetic young people, please watch
http://youthweekendwest.com/ for the announcement of next year's event!
