From The Chair

Hello, Everyone!

With this we’re kicking off a new dance year! With the cooling weather and
beginning of fall activities, we encourage everyone to return the following
Monday, September 8th and clear the dust and cobwebs out of our brains and
limbs and, as I put it in an article for the Vancouver branch, “increase your
joy quota” at our first class of the season.

In addition, coming up will be Fort Worden’s workshop and ball,
http://www.rscds-seattle.org/ftworden/, the Bend – Redmond workshop and ball,
http://hdccd.azurewebsites.net/annual-ball and our own Portland workshop and
ball as well as monthly dances. Information for that can be found at
http://portlandscottishdancers.org 

I’m looking forward to seeing and dancing with you all, sharing our summer
stories, and creating memories in the coming year!

== Let’s Have a Ceilidh ==
by Holly Gibson

In the past, Scottish Country Dancing has had a reasonably active part in the
Portland Highland Games, with demonstrations and audience participation going
on throughout the day. This year, for reasons still not entirely clear to us
participants, there was no time given to either the Portland or Southwest
Washington branches for demonstrating to the public just how much fun they are
missing by not taking up Scottish Country Dancing.

Since there was no dancing during the day, a ceilidh was organized for late in
the afternoon, right after the Highland dancing competition and before the
massed bands began playing. Marge Van Nus called the dances and, with Lisa
Scott and John Taylor as musicians, there was very little sitting around and
watching. When the dancing started, there were approximately 50-60 people in
the room, many of them walking and swirling through The Gay Gordons. Other
dances included Strip the Willow and the Virginia Mountain Reel. It was obvious
that several of the audience participants knew this last dance well because
they had to hold back and not get ahead of the instructions. 

As the time went on, the crowd thinned as people headed to the stadium to watch
the caber toss and the parade of massed bands. Fortunately that didn’t keep
more experienced dancers from pointing, pushing, and pulling new dancers
through The Flowers of Edinburgh. This particular dance was my favorite of the
afternoon. 

My partner was a little boy of about eight. He was definitely all boy with a
black ball cap and slightly blue lips from some afternoon treat. He and I began
as first couple and he dutifully allowed Marge to lead him by the hand through
the first 16 bars. The poussette was a little more of a challenge but when one
dancer outweighs the other by a good bit and is at least two feet taller,
getting them to go the right direction isn’t too difficult. 

After dancing through once, my partner and I went to the bottom of our set and
the dance began. He watched the other dancers and me equally as intently,
making sure he didn’t miss a cue or any signal I might give him. He clapped
with glee as each couple went down the middle and up and even through the
sixteen bars of chasing. Then it was our turn to be first couple. The little
guy never missed a beat, but lead, followed, and skipped all the way through
the dance. I think he had as much fun as I did. When the dance was over he gave
several of us hugs, as did the rest of the family who had been in our set. Then
the parents gathered their clan together and left to watch the bands. As they
went out the door they waved and said goodbye as if we were long lost
relatives. I’m not sure if we’ll see them again in the fall, but if we do it
will probably be like a family reunion.
