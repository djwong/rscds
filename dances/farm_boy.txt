1-8	 All four couples joining hands on the sides set, turn partner halfway to face briefly before casting to the opposite side (half turn and twirl), and all set.
9-12	 1st and 3rd couples, passing outside second place, dance the first half of a strathspey poussette. They begin on opposite sides, and turn a little over halfway at the end to finish in a line in the middle of the set with the women facing up and the men facing down.  Meanwhile, 2nd and 4th couples advance for one bar, set, and retire for one bar.
13-16	 3rd and 1st couples dance back to back with partner while 2nd and 4th couples face up and down to change places on the sides giving right hands, moving up so that they finish with 4th couple in first place and 2nd couple in third place. 4th and 2nd couples face partners and set.
17-20	 Staying close in the middle, 3rd and 1st couples set, turn partner with right hand one quarter to opposite sides to face partner and pull back right shoulder to face out and up.  Meanwhile, 4th and 2nd couples dance half rights and lefts, crossing between 3rd and 1st couples respectively as they are setting.
21-24	 1st and 3rd couples cast up and round the person they are facing (3rd man round 2nd woman, 3rd woman round 2nd man, 1st man round 4th woman, and 1st woman round 4th man) and, giving right hands, cross over to own sides in second and fourth places respectively.
25-32	 All four couples set, turn partners with both hands for two bars to open out, then 2nd with 3rd couple and 4th with 1st couple circle four hands once round to the left.  Repeat with a new top couple.
