Note: On bars 17-24, I like to see the dancers make a wide dramatic arc, which makes it look so much more elegant and uses the space in the set.  2nd and 3rd couples should anticipate the circle for a smooth transition from the corners figure. Vanessa was a member of the Soquel Class with quite a beautiful garden.
