BARS
1–8	First couple lead down and cross below third couple, cast up around the third couple and dance in to meet, lead up and cast around second couple, finishing back to back facing first corners, second couple stepping up on bars seven and eight.
9 – 12	First couple set to first corner for two bars, then set to second corner for two bars.
13 – 16	Pulling back with left shoulders first couple turn one and a quarter times with two hands counterclockwise, to finish in second place on own sides facing out.
17 – 24	All three couples dance reels of three on the sides as in Figure 1, beginning with first couple giving left shoulders to their partner's second corner (first man out and down past third man, first woman up and out past second woman). First couple cross over to opposite sides at both top and bottom. All end in the center of the set ready for promenade.  Note that it is not possible to cover these reels in parallel, as they are really two successive half-reels.  The same person does not pass in front each time. Corner covering is appropriate, second woman with third man, third woman with second man.
25 – 32	All three couples dance a promenade right round. Repeat, having passed a couple.
