Note: Inscribed to my dear friend and teacher from Austin, Texas, Sarah Harriman with whom I have so often shared dancing smiles.  With first couple starting on opposite sides, this dance gives a more symmetrical entrance into the Tournee.

1-4	1st couple cross over giving right hands and set to each other. 
5-6	1st couple and at the same time 2nd couple passing right shoulders, cross over to just inside the sidelines with 1st couple facing down and 2nd couple facing up. (Men will finish the cross over and face with a polite turn.)
7-8	1st and 2nd couples set advancing to form a single line across the dance between 2nd and 1st places. 1st couple remain facing down, 2nd couple remain facing up. (From the women’s side to the men’s side the order is 2nd man, 1st woman, 2nd woman, 1st man.)
9-16	1st and 2nd couples dance the Targe. That is: 
9-10	Women turn right hands ¾ while the men dance ¼ of the way round anti-clockwise to meet the ‘other’ woman. 
11-12	1st man with 2nd woman and 2nd man with 1st woman turn once round with left hands. 
13-14	Women turn right hands ¾ while the men dance ¼ of the way round anti-clockwise to meet the ‘other’ woman again. 
15-16	1st man with 2nd woman and 2nd man with 1st woman turn ¾ round with left hands to finish on the sides. 2nd couple is now in 1st place, 1st couple is in 2nd place on opposite sides.
17-24	2nd and 1st couples dance the Tournee. To begin the women dance forward and the men make the quick turn to face the same direction as their partners. (1st couple at the bottom faces the women’s side, 2nd couple faces the men’s side.) All finish in original places.
25-32	1st and 2nd couples dance the Knot.  Repeat having passed a couple.
