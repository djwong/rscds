<h1>About the Portland RSCDS Branch</h1>

<p></p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>The branch was started around 1978 with the help of Don Gertz of Portland
and Noel Lillie of Seattle.  The branch was accepted into the larger Royal
Scottish Country Dance Society (RSCDS) a few years later.  Since then, our
group has grown to the point that we can form 3-4 sets for most classes.  Every
year we host a ball that draws in around eighty dancers!  We also maintain
close contact with the Southwest Washington branch.</p>
