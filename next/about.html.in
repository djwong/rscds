<h2>What is Scottish Country Dancing?</h2>

<p>Scottish Country Dancing (SCD) is the social dance form of Scotland.  Dances
are typically performed with 3-5 couples, and generally in two lines or in a
square.  The dancers work together to perform a sequence of formations which
eventually bring them back to their starting positions, each couple having
danced as the head couple at least once.  Musicians play lively music in quick
time and dramatic music for passionate dances at events small and large.  The
Royal Scottish Dance Society (<a href="http://www.rscds.org/">RSCDS</a>) has
standardized, reconstructed, and collects new dances for everyone to enjoy.</p>

<p>Scottish Country Dance is very sociable â€“ it is common to dance with many
different partners during a night of dancing, and many dancers in the Pacific
Northwest circulate around the area to the larger functions of the nearby
branches.  Thanks to the standardization efforts of the RSCDS, it is very easy
to dance with other RSCDS groups all over the world, even in the absence of a
common spoken language.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>The branch was started around 1978 with the help of Don Gertz of Portland
and Noel Lillie of Seattle.  The branch was accepted into the larger Society a
few years later.  Since then, our group has grown to the point that we can form
3-4 sets for most <a href="classes.html">classes</a>.  Every year we host a <a
href="workshop.html">workshop and ball</a> that draw in around eighty dancers!
We also maintain close contact with the Southwest Washington State <a
href="http://www.vancouverusa-scd.org/">branch</a>.</p>
