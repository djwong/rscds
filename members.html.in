<h2>RSCDS Member Benefits</h2>

RSCDS members play a valuable role in helping to leave a legacy for future
generations. Membership fees help the Society to train teachers, continue its
work with schools and young people, run and administer examinations and produce
recordings and printed material to complement those activities. This vital
support means the RSCDS is able to preserve a tradition and maintain a
consistency that makes Scottish country dancing the same throughout the world.

The many benefits of membership include:
<ul>
<li>10% discount on most recordings, publications and other items available through our shop</li>
<li>A twice-yearly members’ magazine, Scottish Country Dancer, packed with information and interesting articles, delivered to your door</li>
<li>Access to the members’ area of the RSCDS website</li>
<li>Reduced entrance fees to classes and, in some cases, dances or other events</li>
<li>Tapping into  a worldwide family of Scottish country dancers</li>
<li>Through Branches, a voice in the running of the organization (this applies to Branch members only; members who join directly through Headquarters do not have representation at the AGM)</li>
</ul>

Other, perhaps less tangible, reasons for joining are:

<ul>
<li>Access to RSCDS-trained teachers who take classes at Branch and local level</li>
<li>Access to the annual RSCDS Summer School, Winter School and Spring Fling</li>
<li>Opportunities to advance dancing skills</li>
<li>The chance to learn to teach Scottish country dancing through the Society’s examination and qualification system</li>
<li>Availability of courses for musicians, to encourage the continuation of live music</li>
<li>Availability of music recorded specifically for dancing to, as opposed to listening to</li>
<li>Promotion of the Scottish country dance tradition in schools in Scotland and among young people everywhere</li>
<li>Provision of graded medal tests to encourage young dancers</li>
<li>Learning and helping to preserve and foster original dances and steps</li>
<li>Conserving the present and future existence of this form of dance</li>
<li>Helping to preserve an important aspect of Scottish culture</li>
</ul>
